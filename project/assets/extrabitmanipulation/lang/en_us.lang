jei.description.chiselsandbits:block_bi=Press Extra Bit Manipulation's Throw Bit key binding (default: R) to throw bits like snowballs. They can be deployed from vanilla dispensers, as well. Upon block collision, they place in the world, if possible. If not possible (or if thrown at entities) they drop as items.\nIf not disabled via config, bits with a material of lava ignite blocks/entities and bit with a material of water extinguish them. Throwing a water bit at a Blaze will damage it.


jei.description.extrabitmanipulation:design=Press Extra Bit Manipulation's Edit Chisel Design key binding (default: R) to see the block states in the desing, preview the result up-close, and to remove bits or replace bits with different bits.


jei.description.extrabitmanipulation:bit_wrenc=This wrench can§l rotate§r,§l mirror§r,§l translate§r, or§l invert§r chiseled blocks from Chisels & Bits by right clicking them.\n\nHold the §nChisels and Bits radial menu key§r to change tool settings.\n\nScrolling the mouse wheel while sneaking will cycle through the four modes:\n\n§l§nRotation§l\nClockwise if not sneaking, counter-clockwise if sneaking.\n\n\n§l§nMirroring§l\nFront-to-back if not sneaking, left-to-right if sneaking.\n\n§l§nTranslation§l\nAway from you if not sneaking, towards you if sneaking.\n\n\n§l§nInversion§l\nInverts all bits regardless of whether or not you are sneaking.


jei.description.extrabitmanipulation:sculptin=These sculpting wires and spades remove/add cuboidal, ellipsoidal, cylindrical, conic, or pyramidal areas of bits from chiseled/chiselable blocks.\n\nHold the §nChisels and Bits radial menu key§r to change tool settings.\n§l§nSpades§r\n\n§nLeft click§r blocks to add areas of bits.\n\n§nShift left click§r blocks to set the bit type to add.\n\n\n§l§nWires§r\n\n§nLeft click§r blocks to remove areas of bits.\n\n§nShift left click§r blocks to set the bit type to remove (clicking nothing clears selection, i.e. remove anything).\n§nRight click§r to clycle §lmode§r:\n\n§l1) Drawn§r - click a point on a block and release on another point to alter bits of all chiseled/chiselable blocks intersecting a cuboidal, ellipsoidal, rectangular, or elliptic shape.\n§l2) Global§r - click a point on a block to alter bits of all chiseled/chiselable blocks intersecting a cubic, spherical, square, or circular shape.\n\n§l3) Local§r - click a point on a block to alter bits of that clicked block.\n§nShift scroll§r the mouse wheel to change the removal area radius.\n\n§nControl right click§r to change sculpting shape.\n\n§nControl left click§r to toggle between targeting bits and targeting bit grid vertices (for local/global modes).\n\n§nControl scroll§r the mouse wheel to cycle through sculpting shapes.\n\n§nAlt right click§r to toggle shapes hollow or solid.\n§nAlt left click§r to toggle toggle ends of hollow shapes open or closed.\n\n§nAlt scroll§r the mouse wheel to change wall thickness of hollow shapes.


jei.description.extrabitmanipulation:modeling_too=This modeling tool can create chiseled block models of areas of blocks in the world. Hold the §nChisels and Bits radial menu key§r to change tool settings.\n\n§nLeft click§r blocks to read areas of blocks (up to 16^3 meters). See the tooltip for more specific information about this area, as it is mode-dependent.\n\n§nRight click§r a block to spawn on it a chiseled block model of the read area.\n\n§nShift right click§r to open mapping/preview GUI.\n§nShift scroll§r the mouse wheel to cycle §larea mode§r:\n\n§l1) Centered§r - click block to read a 16^3 m area centered on the nearest block grid vertex (block corner).\n\n\n§l2) Corner§r - click block to read a 16^3 m area with closet corner on the nearest block grid vertex (block corner).\n\n§l3) Drawn§r - click a block and release on another block to read all blocks within the enclosed area.\n§nControl right click§r to toggle whether bit mapping GUI opens upon reading an area.\n\n§nControl scroll§r the mouse wheel to cycle §lchunk snap mode§r:\n\n§l1) Off§r - the area does not snap at all.\n§l2) XYZ§r - the area snaps in the X and Z axes, as described above, and additionally snaps in the Y axis to the 'vertical chunk' (as visualized by pressing F3 + G) the block the player is looking at is in.\n\n\n§l3) XZ§r - the area snaps in the X and Z axes (Y axis is unaffected) to whichever chunk the block the player is looking at is in.
