# 旗帜检测器

![旗帜检测器](block:betterwithaddons:banner_detector@0)

顾名思义,能够检测到旗子的东西.它可以侦测到正前方一定距离内的旗帜,不管是放置在地上的还是生物手上拿着的它都会检测到.与此同时它的检测还能够穿透透明方块(如台阶和玻璃).

When placed next to lattice under the influence of a worldscale, it won't be able to be broken. You can have the same effect by placing it behind iron bars. The container for the banner it uses as comparison can only be accessed from the back of the detector.
此段不译,疑似废弃内容.(其实是因为我没试出效果)
