necronomicon.text.necronomicon.=The Necronomicon itself is a chapter of the Abyssalnomicon, which was read to Alhazred by a demon known as J'zahar, who had composed the Abyssalnomicon from infinite knowledge known to The Great Old Ones.
necronomicon.text.necronomicon.=There are 4 types of Necronomicons within the Abyssalnomicon: The Necronomicon, The Abyssal Wasteland Necronomicon, knowledge bound to a specific dimension.
necronomicon.text.necronomicon.=In order to unlock the knowledge, one must travel to said dimension and empower the Necronomicon with the flesh of that world. The Abyssalnomicon contains additional knowledge known only to J'zahar, knowledge man was not meant to obtain.


necronomicon.text.abyssalnomicon.=This is the Abyssalnomicon, a book written by J'zahar, Gatekeeper of The Abyss. The book contains the knowledge of the 4 Necronomicons, as they are in fact chapters of this book. There is also extensive knowledge not mentioned in the others.
necronomicon.text.abyssalnomicon.=As the knowledge about spells and rituals is limited to the specified dimension (and previous ones, depending on the Necronomicon type), the Abyssalnomcion has all knowledge collected in one place, with additions.


necronomicon.text.abyssalcraft.=AbyssalCraft is the mod which this book is used to guide you through. It's mainly focused on exploration, with 4 new dimensions you can explore.
necronomicon.text.abyssalcraft.=The dimensions are reached through the use of "Gateway Keys", which are keys designed to create portals between dimensions (the 4th dimension is reached by falling out of the 3rd).
necronomicon.text.abyssalcraft.=The Overworld has been expanded with 6 new biomes: the Darklands (normal, plains, forest, highlands, mountain) and the Coralium Infested Swamp.

necronomicon.text.nyarlathotep.=Nyarlathotep, The Crawling Chaos, is an Outer God who isn't exiled nor imprisoned.
necronomicon.text.nyarlathotep.=He walks the earth hidden among the humans, spreading madness. Apart from serving cults of the Outer Gods, he fulfills the wishes of Azathoth, whom he serves.
necronomicon.text.yog-sothoth.=Yog-Sothoth, The Lurker at the Threshold, is an Outer God, and the offspring of the Nameless Mist.
necronomicon.text.yog-sothoth.=It is heavily implied, if not outright stated, that Yog-Sothoth is omniscient, and is locked outside the universe, meaning he knows and can see all of space-time all at once, that there is no secret hidden from Yog-Sothoth.
necronomicon.text.shub-niggurath.=Shub-Niggurath, The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young, is an Outer God in the pantheon.
necronomicon.text.shub-niggurath.=She is a perverse fertility deity, said to appear as an enormous cloudy mass which extrudes black tentacles, slime-dripping mouths, and short, writhing goat legs. Small creatures are continually spat forth by the monstrosity, which are reconsumed or escape
necronomicon.text.cthulhu.=Cthulhu is a Great Old One, trapped in a endless sleep underneath the sea in the city R'lyeh.
necronomicon.text.cthulhu.=He has the head of a octopus, and a scaly body with wings on his back. His state of endless sleep comes from a war against the Elder Beings, which ended with R'lyeh sinking to the bottom of the sea. One day he will rise to rule over the earth.
necronomicon.text.hastur.=Hastur, The Unspeakable, is a Great Old One and Cthulhu's half-brother.
necronomicon.text.hastur.=Not much is known about Hastur, but he is known to take the form of a king in yellow robes, wearing a mask. Like most Great Old Ones, he is capable of taking any form he desires.
necronomicon.text.jzahar.=J'zahar, Gatekeeper of The Abyss, is the bastard offspring of Hastur.
necronomicon.text.jzahar.=Having a desire for power, and not wanting exile to the stars, J'zahar reached out beyond time and space to achieve his freedom. The results were similar powers to that of Yog-Sothoth, and the punishment of eternally guarding his imprisoned fellow deities.


necronomicon.text.greatoldone=Before the ages of man, the universe was ruled by a race of ancient demonic gods known as "The Great Old ones". Due to a conflict aeons ago, all of these beings are imprisoned far away where no man has ever set foot.
necronomicon.text.abyssalnomicon_inf=The Abyssalnomicon is the unholy tome from which the Necronomicon was written, when J'zahar read that section to Alhazred.

necronomicon.text.abyssa=This is the first layer of the Abyss, a place that's dark, green, and populated by the undead. Oblivionaire is said to be the one watching over this place, or his dragon, Asorah. Likely where Coralium originates from.
necronomicon.text.dreadland=Previously a world of Abyssalnite, the Dreadlands got it's name when the Dread Plague was unleashed on it, killing all miners and corrupting the peaceful Abyssalnite Golems. The second layer of the Abyss holds lost souls of the living.
necronomicon.text.omotho=A endless temple city built at the very edge of sanity. The Realm of J'zahar holds the only entrance to where The Great Old Ones dwell. The Gatekeeper is always watching, and nobody leaves the final layer of the Abyss alive.
necronomicon.text.darkreal=Beneath Omothol lies the realm where the immortal souls of evil demonic gods rest, awaiting their reincarnation. The Dark Realm is where living shadows are born, and the last place a living souls should ever visit, as they will face eternal suffering.

necronomicon.text.materials.darklandsgrass.=Darklands Grass is a new type of grass found in Darklands biomes. Compared to regular grass, this one is purple and emits nether portal particles randomly.
necronomicon.text.materials.darklandsgrass.=Another difference is that you can't plant regular trees on it, only the ones added in AbyssalCraft (Darklands Oak, Dreadlands Tree). However, flowers, tall grass and mushrooms will grow here.

necronomicon.text.materials.pearlescentcoralium.=Due to the item gained from the ore, it is quite rare, and generates around Y = 10 and below.
necronomicon.text.materials.liquidcoralium.=Liquid Coralium is a new liquid found within the Abyssal Wasteland. It has the ability to transmute elements on contact, as in converting any water-based liquid into itself, and most stone types into Abyssal Stone.
necronomicon.text.materials.liquidcoralium.=It also infects entities that touches it with the Coralium Plague, killing them if they aren't immune. Some entities can be converted into Abyssal Zombies on death. If the liquid collides with Liquid Antimatter, it will convert into Coralium Stone.
necronomicon.text.materials.powerstonedreadlands.=Dreadlands Infused Powerstone is a special stone found deep within Abyssal Strongholds. You need a pickaxe stronger or equal to a Refined Coralium Pickaxe in order to mine it.
necronomicon.text.materials.powerstonedreadlands.=If you collide with it, you will receive the Dread Plague. Once mined, it can be used to upgrade your Gateway Key if you have the other components.
necronomicon.text.materials.dreadstone.=Dreadstone is a stone found commonly in the Dreadlands. It was formerly Abyssalnite Stone that was converted by the Dread Plague aeons ago. You can turn it into Dreadstone Bricks.
necronomicon.text.materials.dreadstone.=It is also used in when crafting the Altar of Cha'garoth.
necronomicon.text.materials.abyssalnitestone.=Abyssalnite Stone is a stone found within the Purified Dreadlands biome inside the Dreadlands. You can turn it into Abyssalnite Stone Bricks.
necronomicon.text.materials.abyssalnitestone.=This was formerly what the Dreadlands was made out of before it became the Dreadlands, since the dimension was once a gigantic mine hosting the largest amount of pure Abyssalnite.
necronomicon.text.materials.dreadlandsabyssalnite.=Dreadlands Abyssalnite is a variant of Abyssalnite found in the Dreadlands. The ore gained from mining it can be smelted for Abyssalnite Ingots.

necronomicon.text.materials.dreadedabyssalnite.=Dreaded Abyssalnite is a variant of Abyssalnite found in the Dreadlands. The ore gained from mining it can be smelted for Abyssalnite Ingots.
necronomicon.text.materials.dreadedabyssalnite.=If you crystallize this ore, you can get Dreadium Crystals, as this form of Abyssalnite has been corrupted by the Dread Plague.

necronomicon.text.materials.omotholstone.=
necronomicon.text.materials.ethaxium.=Ethaxium is a new material most commonly appearing in Omothol as the material used for structures built there. Ethaxium is extremely hard, and can thus only be destroyed with tools made from it.
necronomicon.text.materials.ethaxium.=Ethaxium is said to be what souls are made out of, which likely explains why it's almost indestructible. No wonder J'zahar built his temple city from this.
necronomicon.text.materials.darkethaxium.=Dark Ethaxium is a stronger version of Ethaxium created by combining regular Ethaxium with Omothol Stone. This kind of Ethaxium is harder than it's normal counterpart.
necronomicon.text.materials.darkethaxium.=This material is only used in one structure, the Temple of J'zahar.
necronomicon.text.materials.ritualaltar.=The Ritual Altar is the main component in performing rituals. It's used by shift right-clicking on it with a Necronomicon that has sufficient Potential Energy. For successful rituals, the nearby Ritual Pedestals will need the correct offerings placed on them.

Both recipes are found in the special materials section.
necronomicon.text.dreadlands.progression.=Once you have both Altar pieces, you need to place them at Y = 40 inside a Dreadlands Mountain biome and right-click it.

The key needs to be transmuted into a functioning one.
necronomicon.text.dreadlands.progression.=With the aforementioned Transmutator (recipe in Abyssal Wasteland special materials section) you can transmute the Dread-plagued Gateway Key into Cha'garoth's R'lyehian Gateway Key, granting you access to Omothol. Upgrading your Necronomicon to the Omothol Necronomicon requires 8 Skins of Omothol.


necronomicon.text.omothol.progression.=Now that you've arrived in Omothol, it's time to battle J'zahar, Gatekeeper of The Abyss. This dimension is currently incomplete, so there isn't that much to do here apart from getting materials to craft the Abyssalnomicon.

necronomicon.text.rituals.inf=Check the information section for information regarding rituals, or the other sections for information about available rituals. "Location" specifies where the ritual can be performed.


necronomicon.text.rituals.=In order to get started with rituals you need to create the altar to perform them at. There is a total of 8 materials you can create your Ritual Altar from.
necronomicon.text.rituals.=Those are: Cobblestone, Darkstone Cobblestone, Abyssal Stone Brick, Coralium Brick, Dreadstone Brick, Abyssalnite Stone Brick, Ethaxium Brick and Dark Ethaxium Brick. The materials can only be used in their specific dimension (eg. Cobblestone and Darkstone Cobblestone in the Overworld, Abyssal Stone Brick and Coralium Brick in the Abyssal Wasteland etc).
necronomicon.text.rituals.=To create the altar, simply place the blocks in the above formation (keep the red area clear) and shift right-click the center block with a Necronomicon.
necronomicon.text.rituals.=After that, you can start performing rituals! In order to perform a ritual, place objects on the pedestals and shift right-click the altar with a Necronomicon.
necronomicon.text.rituals.=When peforming, the pedestals project smoke towards the altar. Rituals where you gain objects always end with a bolt of lightning striking the altar.
necronomicon.text.rituals.=Potential Energy is required in order to perform rituals (each ritual entry shows how much you need). Potential Energy is a pure form of untapped energy originating from a higher plane of existence. It's mainly used to fuel sacrifices made to The Great Old Ones (any ritual). Statues placed on Shoggoth Monoliths are said to be capable of draining it.


necronomicon.text.pe.=Potential Energy (PE) is a new form of energy presented in AbyssalCraft. It originates from a higher plane of existence (where no mortal has wandered), and can only be collected by tapping into Ley Lines using various methods. There exist objects capable of doing so, which will be explained here.
necronomicon.text.pe.=A good place to start obtaining materials required to create some of the PE collecting objects is Shoggoth Lairs, found in swamps and rivers.
necronomicon.text.pe.=Shoggoth Monoliths are also constructed with Monolith Stone (hence the name), while having statues placed on them. These statues can collect PE.
necronomicon.text.pe.=The statues come in different shapes, all depicting Great Old Ones. Standing close to one while holding a Necronomicon allows it to transport PE to you.
necronomicon.text.pe.=It should be noted that you harvesting PE isn't appreciated. This causes disruptions to occur (displayed by a bolt of lightning striking the statue, or other PE manipulator). Disruptions are random events that can affect the player, other entities or the environment. Their purpose is to punish those who tries to drain PE from the higher plane.
necronomicon.text.pe.=One way to boost the efficiency of statues (and other PE manipulators) is through the use of Ritual Charms. They can boost various stats (check the tooltip).
necronomicon.text.pe.=You can also craft a Energy Pedestal, which can collect PE from statues (and other PE manipulators) that are placed 3 blocks from the pedestal.
necronomicon.text.pe.=Along with the Energy Pedestal there's the Sacrificial Altar, which can convert life-force from dying entities into PE (targeted entities emit smoke).
necronomicon.text.pe.=If the PE production still is too slow, you can also upgrade Energy Pedestals and Sacrificial Altars through infusion rituals.
necronomicon.text.pe.1=Upon reaching Omothol, you will be able to create deity-specific Ritual Charms (with an Abyssalnomicon), or buy them from Remnant Priests. Those charms will give an additional boost if used on manipulators associated with the same deity as the one displayed on the charm.


necronomicon.text.machines.inf=Check the information section for information regarding the different machines, or the other sections for all recipes for the specified machine. The recipes aren't sorted in any way.


necronomicon.text.machines.=The Transmutator is used to transmute objects into other objects, which can revert a process or simply convert an object into it's opposite. It's fueled by any Coralium materials, Coralium-plagued Flesh and any Crystallized element (full crystal or shard).
necronomicon.text.machines.=The Crystallizer is used to crystallize elements, isolating the base elements (or molecules) they're made from. It's fueled by any Dreaded material, Dread Fragments and any Crystallized element (full crystal or shard).
necronomicon.text.machines.=The Engraver is used to engrave coins, allowing you to trade things with Remnant. The "fuel" used in engraving is engraving templates, that wear out after a certain amount of uses. If you want to re-engrave a coin, you have to use a blank engraving on it first (to un-engrave it).
necronomicon.text.machines.=The Materializer is used to create objects by combining base elements (obtained through crystallization). The Materializer uses no fuel, but requires a Necronomicon to function, and a Crystal Bag with crystals to materialize objects from.
