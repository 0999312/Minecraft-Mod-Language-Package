lord.water.convM111.line5=had studied all he could from the people
lord.water.convM111.line6=of the realm, he meditated for many years
lord.water.convM111.line7=still, until eventually he found a way to
lord.water.convM111.line8=purify that which he had learned to control
lord.water.convM111.line9=raw energy itself. During the last elemental
lord.water.convM111.line10=cycle he returned to the world, he faced
lord.water.convM111.line11=down the great generals of the opposing
lord.water.convM111.line12=factions, striking them both down ending the
lord.water.convM111.line13=war once and for all.

lord.water.convM12.line1=Last I saw of Zaloweist... he said he was
lord.water.convM12.line2=looking for someone who had gone missing.
lord.water.convM12.line3=I can't quite place who it was though,
lord.water.convM12.line4=it's... it's almost as though those memories
lord.water.convM12.line5=are gone from my mind, but yet I picture them
lord.water.convM12.line6=so vividly other than about who it was.

lord.water.convM121.line1=I believe he had tracked this individual to
lord.water.convM121.line2=the Void, the area between the universes.
lord.water.convM121.line3=Since Zaloweist entered it, we have not seen
lord.water.convM121.line4=him, but whispers of his existence still
lord.water.convM121.line5=spread. But we know better for the Thelos
lord.water.convM121.line6=can only be reborn in another when the last
lord.water.convM121.line7=is gone from reality, and as you know...
lord.water.convM121.line8=you are a Thelos so...

lord.water.convM2.line1=I am Aqua, Overlord of Water. The Overlords
lord.water.convM2.line2=are the most powerful lords in the realms.
lord.water.convM2.line3=We govern and protect this universe using
lord.water.convM2.line4=our control over the elements.
lord.water.convM2.line5=Of course with proper training you will
lord.water.convM2.line6=soon be more powerful than us. Then you too
lord.water.convM2.line7=may join us here in this temple as the leader.

lord.water.convM3.line1=What do you want to say?

lord.water.convM31.line1=You have not finished your current quest.
lord.water.convM32.line1=Ah great, here are your rewards!
lord.water.convM33.line1=Here is your new assignment.
lord.water.convM34.line1=You don't have a quest.

lord.water.convML1.line1=You have done well and I now name you my
lord.water.convML1.line2=apprentice, you are now eligible to learn
lord.water.convML1.line3=your first water spell from me.
lord.water.convML1.line4=I have given you your spell focus already.
lord.water.convML1.line5=With that in hand you shall be able to
lord.water.convML1.line6=use your internal energy to heal yourself
lord.water.convML1.line7=It can even heal others as an alternate
lord.water.convML1.line8=effect. Use it wisely.

lord.water.convML11.line1=But wait Thelos, there is more!

lord.water.convML12.line1=Indeed there is more I have a special
lord.water.convML12.line2=task for you since you have proven yourself.
lord.water.convML12.line3=I would like you to use your spell a number
lord.water.convML12.line4=of times, but you must make sure that you
lord.water.convML12.line5=only count the times in which it actually
lord.water.convML12.line6=has effect, when you or another is hurt.

lord.water.convML2.line1=I am pleased that you have continued your
lord.water.convML2.line2=training thus far. I have another spell for
lord.water.convML2.line3=you to try, it's called Whirlpool.
lord.water.convML2.line4=It entraps and confuses targets
lord.water.convML2.line5=in a radius of where you are looking.

lord.water.convML21.line1=Good luck Thelos!

lord.water.convML3.line1=Here we are again, ready to learn more.
lord.water.convML3.line2=You know what I am going to ask you to do.

lord.water.convML4.line1=You are doing well so far, now I would
lord.water.convML4.line2=like you to use your new spell
lord.water.convML4.line3=Rainfall, this spell can change the
lord.water.convML4.line4=weather. It will even keep it from raining
lord.water.convML4.line5=for a long time after you stop it.

lord.water.convML5.line1=You are now advanced enough to use your
lord.water.convML5.line2=tier 2 elemental powers, I can teach you
lord.water.convML5.line3=the theory for this one but you will have
lord.water.convML5.line4=to adapt it for whichever you know.

lord.water.convML51.line1=There... Now you understand it please
lord.water.convML51.line2=use this knowledge well, return when
lord.water.convML51.line3=you feel ready for more tasks.

lord.water.convML6.line1=You have reached your maximum potential
lord.water.convML6.line2=bar this one technique...
lord.water.convML6.line3=Good, now that you know that you can
lord.water.convML6.line4=unleash your power on the world.
lord.water.convML6.line5=If you continue to do quests for me
lord.water.convML6.line6=I can give you a larger mana pool as per.


lord.earth.conv1.line1=You have proven yourself Thelos. I will admit,
lord.earth.conv1.line2=I doubted my sister at first, but you have
lord.earth.conv1.line3=certainly exceeded all of my expectations.

lord.earth.conv11.line1=Please Thelos, you should not be thanking me.
lord.earth.conv11.line2=I doubted you, I do not deserve your thanks.
lord.earth.conv11.line3=You are kind beyond those who came before you.

lord.earth.conv12.line1=As I suspected, full of wisdom.

lord.earth.conv13.line1=I am glad.

lord.earth.conv2.line1=Yes my sister did mention that you might.
lord.earth.conv2.line2=Alas there is much work to be done, this will
lord.earth.conv2.line3=not be an easy task for you to undertake.
lord.earth.conv2.line4=Are you ready to train yourself to be one with
lord.earth.conv2.line5=the very thing upon which you stand?

lord.earth.conv21.line1=Then we shall begin at once my new apprentice!

lord.earth.convM.line1=Greetings Thelos, it is good to see you again.
lord.earth.convM.line2=Was there something that you wanted?

lord.earth.convM1.line1=Go ahead.

lord.earth.convM11.line1=I am Terra Overlord of Earth. I believe in the
lord.earth.convM11.line2=balance of the worlds, a steady place where
lord.earth.convM11.line3=change is slight and so well rounded, to plan
lord.earth.convM11.line4=ahead rather than to rush hastily into things.
lord.earth.convM11.line5=That is the way of the earth and so it is the
lord.earth.convM11.line6=way of myself.

lord.earth.convM12.line1=Well I know little of you, but you are not the
lord.earth.convM12.line2=first Thelos to come here as of late, of course
lord.earth.convM12.line3=Zaloweist created this place, he did great
lord.earth.convM12.line4=things in his time. Then there is Luxios, she
lord.earth.convM12.line5=came here looking to learn, but she discovered
lord.earth.convM12.line6=something that caused her to turn on us...

lord.earth.convM121.line1=Zaloweist was the greatest lord to have ever
lord.earth.convM121.line2=lived, master of lightning and the will of
lord.earth.convM121.line3=the elements. Maybe in time you will surpass
lord.earth.convM121.line4=him, but be wary for he was brought up in a
lord.earth.convM121.line5=time of war, oppressed by all he learned
lord.earth.convM121.line6=the failings of those around him, and through
lord.earth.convM121.line7=that he obtained the strength to achieve all
lord.earth.convM121.line8=that he did. This is something that you are
lord.earth.convM121.line9=unlikely to ever see, perhaps you should be
lord.earth.convM121.line10=glad to live in such a time of peace as now.

lord.earth.convM122.line1=Luxios was the second Thelos to be revealed
lord.earth.convM122.line2=to the world. She fell to the corruption of
lord.earth.convM122.line3=great power, too hasty I say. The others think
lord.earth.convM122.line4=there may have been more to it but, I know
lord.earth.convM122.line5=well the hearts of humans. It is this evil
lord.earth.convM122.line6=that we feared within you, I should have not
lord.earth.convM122.line7=seen it in you, I was too quick to judge.
lord.earth.convM122.line8=I have fallen prey to the very thing I seek
lord.earth.convM122.line9=to avoid, I regret my actions and hope to
lord.earth.convM122.line10=make amends by training you in the art of
lord.earth.convM122.line11=earth.

lord.earth.convM123.line1=Did I say there were others? I don't remember
lord.earth.convM123.line2=I guess I suggested that there might have been
lord.earth.convM123.line3=more but... I am not quite sure, some force
lord.earth.convM123.line4=has blocked our vision for many years, we
lord.earth.convM123.line5=have often found ourselves unable to fully
lord.earth.convM123.line6=recall certain actions and events. I am not
lord.earth.convM123.line7=sure if there were others, but yet...
lord.earth.convM123.line8=It feels as though there were...

lord.earth.convM13.line1=The others are discussing many things that do
lord.earth.convM13.line2=not concern you as of yet, they may in time,
lord.earth.convM13.line3=but I should not divulge such secrets until
lord.earth.convM13.line4=the others say I should. In fact you will
lord.earth.convM13.line5=probably hear from them rather than me.

lord.earth.convM2.line1=We are the Overlords, the most powerful lords
lord.earth.convM2.line2=in the realms, we are siblings and we are
lord.earth.convM2.line3=tasked with keeping order in this place.

lord.earth.convM3.line1=What do you want to say?

lord.earth.convM31.line1=You have not finished your current quest.
lord.earth.convM32.line1=Ah great, here are your rewards!
lord.earth.convM33.line1=Here is your new assignment.
lord.earth.convM34.line1=You don't have a quest.

lord.earth.convML1.line1=You have done well so far, I will alert
lord.earth.convML1.line2=the others of your progress, they may take
lord.earth.convML1.line3=interest in having you as an apprentice.
lord.earth.convML1.line4=It can never be a guarantee with them but
lord.earth.convML1.line5=time will tell as it always does.
lord.earth.convML1.line6=I have a special assignment for you now.
lord.earth.convML1.line7=I want you to try out this spell.
lord.earth.convML1.line8=I call it Stone Shot, it will fire a stone
lord.earth.convML1.line9=projectile in the direction you are facing.
lord.earth.convML1.line10=Use it well Thelos.

lord.earth.convML2.line1=Once again I am most pleased with your work.
lord.earth.convML2.line2=You have shown much of what it means to be
lord.earth.convML2.line3=the Thelos! For the work you have done I wish
lord.earth.convML2.line4=for you to try this new spell of mine.
lord.earth.convML2.line5=I have tuned the Stone Shot spell for combat.
lord.earth.convML2.line6=It is more efficient, so much so that you
lord.earth.convML2.line7=will find yourself able to launch an array
lord.earth.convML2.line8=of projectiles. I call it Scatter Shot.
lord.earth.convML2.line9=Please return once you have finished.

lord.earth.convML3.line1=Your progress has been steady, you are close
lord.earth.convML3.line2=to truly understanding what it means to be a
lord.earth.convML3.line3=lord of earth. Now I show you a technique
lord.earth.convML3.line4=that can be a challenge to master but when
lord.earth.convML3.line5=used correctly can prove to be formidable.
lord.earth.convML3.line6=it is called Earth-Shaker, the idea here is
lord.earth.convML3.line7=to assume a strong stance, inhale deeply.
lord.earth.convML3.line8=Then as you exhale slam your fist with all
lord.earth.convML3.line9=your might into the ground beneath you.
lord.earth.convML3.line10=Do this and you will be well on your way.

lord.earth.convML4.line1=This is the last basic technique I can teach.
lord.earth.convML4.line2=This we call Smash, it breaks terrain around
lord.earth.convML4.line3=the area you are looking, it has an alternate
lord.earth.convML4.line4=effect which is for precision digging.

lord.earth.convML5.line1=Well, as I said before the basic spells have
lord.earth.convML5.line2=run dry and so I must now teach you theory
lord.earth.convML5.line3=for the advanced set of spells, the idea for
lord.earth.convML5.line4=the first of these is to feel the world
lord.earth.convML5.line5=around you, do not act but rather wait, listen
lord.earth.convML5.line6=it will tell you what the best course is.
lord.earth.convML5.line7=Then with your will, visualise the results
lord.earth.convML5.line8=and you shall see the effect.

lord.earth.convML6.line1=I am proud of you my Thelos, you have done
lord.earth.convML6.line2=so much in such a short time. I have not
lord.earth.convML6.line3=seen skills like yours in many years.
lord.earth.convML6.line4=I trust you now Thelos, and your judgement.
lord.earth.convML6.line5=If you ever need my support here, know that
lord.earth.convML6.line6=I will be behind you in almost any event.
lord.earth.convML6.line7=But now it is time for your last lesson.
lord.earth.convML6.line8=Think back to our last, feel the breath
lord.earth.convML6.line9=of the world within you, now hold it,
lord.earth.convML6.line10=let it fill you, then exhale slowly.
lord.earth.convML6.line11=Open your eyes and observe your power.


lord.air.conv1.line1=Thelos, you have kept me waiting!
lord.air.conv1.line2=I am Aer, Overlord of Air and I live as
lord.air.conv1.line3=my element does, swift and ever
lord.air.conv1.line4=changing. Lords of Air are unbound
lord.air.conv1.line5=unlike the others around us.

lord.air.conv11.line1=It was rude of me to sound so...
lord.air.conv11.line2=frustrated with you for it was not your
lord.air.conv11.line3=fault, it is I who should apologise.

lord.air.conv12.line1=Though you are correct, your tone
lord.air.conv12.line2=is not one which I find
lord.air.conv12.line3=wholly promising.

lord.air.conv111.line1=I suspected as much, Aqua spoke
lord.air.conv111.line2=highly of you and so I trust
lord.air.conv111.line3=that you will make a worthy
lord.air.conv111.line4=apprentice. We shall begin
lord.air.conv111.line5=your training at once!

lord.air.convM.line1=Greetings Thelos, it is good to see you again.
lord.air.convM.line2=Was there something that you wanted?

lord.air.convM1.line1=Go ahead.

lord.air.convM11.line1=I am Aer, Overlord of Air which means
lord.air.convM11.line2=that I like my siblings are the most
lord.air.convM11.line3=skilled of our class within the realms.

lord.air.convM111.line1=Yes, realms... each of us governs a
lord.air.convM111.line2=dimension that is heavily influenced
lord.air.convM111.line3=by our elements. Though they share
lord.air.convM111.line4=similarities they differ greatly.

lord.air.convM1111.line1=That's not for me to say, only
lord.air.convM1111.line2=Lux would be able to give you entry
lord.air.convM1111.line3=since she knew the old Thelos the best
lord.air.convM1111.line4=she would be able to sense the evil
lord.air.convM1111.line5=within you, better than any of us.

lord.air.convM12.line1=I know that you are capable and
lord.air.convM12.line2=I know that you are the Thelos...
lord.air.convM12.line3=That's about it really.

lord.air.convM13.line1=You noticed that... impressive.
lord.air.convM13.line2=We aren't actually siblings.
lord.air.convM13.line3=You see after the Lord Wars of old
lord.air.convM13.line4=the Thelos Zaloweist decided that
lord.air.convM13.line5=the best way to keep the peace would
lord.air.convM13.line6=not be to put war grizzled veterans
lord.air.convM13.line7=in charge of their respective groups
lord.air.convM13.line8=but rather a wholly new group of
lord.air.convM13.line9=individuals, and so he created us.
lord.air.convM13.line10=We are designed to best represent our
lord.air.convM13.line11=given element, so as not to frustrate
lord.air.convM13.line12=the members of each nation.

lord.air.convM2.line1=Well you see it is connected to
lord.air.convM2.line2=each of our realms, the platforms
lord.air.convM2.line3=outside allow us to travel from
lord.air.convM2.line4=here to there. Though you
lord.air.convM2.line5=will not be able to enter until
lord.air.convM2.line6=Lux trusts you, we cannot risk
lord.air.convM2.line7=the safety of our peoples.

lord.air.convM3.line1=What do you want to say?

lord.air.convM31.line1=You have not finished your current quest.
lord.air.convM32.line1=Ah great, here are your rewards!
lord.air.convM33.line1=Here is your new assignment.
lord.air.convM34.line1=You don't have a quest.

lord.air.convML1.line1=I am glad that you are doing well.
lord.air.convML1.line2=It has been a long while since
lord.air.convML1.line3=I have had the pleasure of training
lord.air.convML1.line4=one with such talent as a mage.
lord.air.convML1.line5=Now to teach you your first spell.
lord.air.convML1.line6=By focusing your mind and feeling
lord.air.convML1.line7=the air currents around you, you
lord.air.convML1.line8=should find yourself able to shift
lord.air.convML1.line9=them, forcing them to drive your
lord.air.convML1.line10=foes into the air.

lord.air.convML2.line1=You are impressing me more and more,
lord.air.convML2.line2=Thelos. It is good to see you
lord.air.convML2.line3=eager to learn more! Now I shall
lord.air.convML2.line4=teach you another spell, before
lord.air.convML2.line5=I told you to force the air
lord.air.convML2.line6=to lift your foes, but now I want
lord.air.convML2.line7=you to give it time to build up
lord.air.convML2.line8=then, once you feel you have
lord.air.convML2.line9=held it enough release it in
lord.air.convML2.line10=a cutting motion.

lord.air.convML3.line1=You again fail to disappoint me.
lord.air.convML3.line2=Now to teach you the signature
lord.air.convML3.line3=Overlord technique but this time
lord.air.convML3.line4=for air. This is much like the
lord.air.convML3.line5=others, just focus your mind
lord.air.convML3.line6=and you will find the element
lord.air.convML3.line7=come to your call.

lord.air.convML4.line1=This next lesson will involve
lord.air.convML4.line2=building a trust between you
lord.air.convML4.line3=and the air itself, no longer
lord.air.convML4.line4=are you just commanding, now
lord.air.convML4.line5=you are part of it. Only with
lord.air.convML4.line6=this in mind will you be able
lord.air.convML4.line7=to perform flight, borne aloft
lord.air.convML4.line8=by the trust you form.

lord.air.convML5.line1=Now my training will have to be
lord.air.convML5.line2=more generalised, since this
lord.air.convML5.line3=technique can apply in two ways.
lord.air.convML5.line4=Before we lifted our foes with
lord.air.convML5.line5=the air, but I feel we can
lord.air.convML5.line6=focus this better, to either
lord.air.convML5.line7=disperse them, or have you
lord.air.convML5.line8=ride the wind towards your goal.

lord.air.convML6.line1=This is the last technique I can
lord.air.convML6.line2=show you. The power to lift
lord.air.convML6.line3=entities is at your fingertips
lord.air.convML6.line4=whether it be yourself or others
lord.air.convML6.line5=that will be up to you to decide.
lord.air.convML6.line6=Focus the wind, feel it twist in
lord.air.convML6.line7=your hands, and direct its destiny!

book.page1=Lord Craft is designed to take the magic stage of TSON Craft and extend it by placing the player into a different age. By this I mean within the lore, the magic in TSON did not exist at the same time as the magic here. You may see many of the same blocks but their actions will be different simply due to the magic driving them. We shall see the precursor to runes the Staves and many other magical items. Another change is the idea that you will need to do research in order to use some items within the mod.
book.page2=Research is done by first selecting the §nResearch§r Section of this book, doing so will open the research tree. To do a research you will first need §nInscription Tiles§r in your inventory. A research will request you to enter various glyphs by connecting the various dots together, the glyphs to draw can be seen using §nJEI§r or by using an §nArcane Inscriber§r. Once a letter is typed in for the first time you will be able to shortcut the letter by clicking on it on the right or by typing the letter on your keyboard. A single inscription tile is used up per glyph entered!
book.page4=The mana system works by use of a block known as the §nVoid Interface§r. This block allows you to interact with your mana pool to increase your mana capacity you place an §nElemental Siphon§r into it and then to fill it insert an §nElemental Crystal§r. The mana is actually split up between each element so you will need the siphon and respective crystals for the element of your choice. Mana can be checked on the go using a Void Eye. Even if the interface is destroyed your mana will not be lost!
book.page5=Memory Eliminators are items that are used to reset your progress in Lord Craft. This has been useful for my bug testing however I can see some use for it in actual situations and so they have remained in the game.
book.page6=Research for this is obtained by first binding a §nBook of Transmutative Knowledge§r to you by right clicking it. Then you must place it onto a §nTransmutation Research Table§r. The interface allows you to insert items to research on the left and the list of research items will appear on the right, items can be researched up to 10 times and the more times it is done the more efficient the conversions will be. High value items can fail research! The §nLordic Altar§r is used to perform transmutation, first place your book on it, then right click with an empty hand to change the mana type it will pull from. §nRight click with an item to turn it in for energy§r. §nAlternate Effect + Right Click to produce the item in your hand with energy§r.
book.page7=Holding the spell focus will show a UI in your top left corner, showing the spell selection and a mana bar, spells are unlocked by doing quests for the overlords, for the first 6 levels you will unlock a new spell. You can change which spell you have selected by sneaking and scrolling with your mouse wheel. The mana these spells use recharges over time and has it's maximum value increased as you level up. This mana is shared across all elements!
book.page9=This research is obtained by doing quests for the Overlords in the §nLordic Nexus§r, you can go there using the §nAscension Matrix§r. This research allows you to create §nVoid Crystals§r which can be used to hold the mana you obtain from these quests for use in powering powerful void stage devices such as the §nVoid Altar§r.
book.page10=Requires 4 different attachments these are: §nIO Matrix§r, §nCrystal Receptacle§r, §nBook Receptacle§r, §nTemplate Receptacle§r. When all are in place the altar can be used by placing items in the §nIO Matrix§r, these will be consumed to make the item in the template. The more mana stored in the §nVoid Crystal§r in the §nCrystal Receptacle§r the faster the output is produced. Higher value items take longer to make! This does require transmutation research to function just like the §nLordic Altar§r!
book.page11=This is a void stage version of the §nArcane Forge§r. Similar to all other void stage devices it is powered using a §nVoid Crystal§r. Once placed it will link to your research however if you want to link one that you didn't place or if it somehow became unlinked you just have to §nAlternate Effect + Right Click§r it.

res1.text=My initial inspection of this land proved to be fairly useful, it showed that there is indeed magical potential here, with the right focus I may be able to harness this for my own purpose.
res2.text=I have chosen to attune my own aura to the element of water. I feel my aura changing just like the shifting tides with more study I hope to unlock some greater purpose in my power.
res3.text=I have chosen to attune my own aura to the element of earth. I feel my aura halting like the steady mountain with more study I hope to unlock some greater purpose in my power.
res4.text=I have chosen to attune my own aura to the element of fire. I feel my aura burning like the wild fire with more study I hope to unlock some greater purpose in my power.
res5.text=I have chosen to attune my own aura to the element of fire. I feel my aura soaring like the fresh breeze with more study I hope to unlock some greater purpose in my power.
res6.text=I have chosen to attune my own aura to the element of light. my aura seems weak almost... gone with more study I hope to find a way to restore my aura.
res7.text=I have chosen to attune my own aura to the element of light. my aura seems strong perhaps... too much with more study I hope to find a way to calm my aura.
res8.text=With some study I have found a way to morph the elemental crystals to my own design. With this in mind I should be able to craft tools from them like I do with the other materials of this world.
res9.text=With some study I have found a way to morph the elemental crystals to my own design. With this in mind I should be able to craft tools from them like I do with the other materials of this world.
res10.text=With some study I have found a way to morph the elemental crystals to my own design. With this in mind I should be able to craft tools from them like I do with the other materials of this world.
res11.text=With some study I have found a way to morph the elemental crystals to my own design. With this in mind I should be able to craft tools from them like I do with the other materials of this world.

res13.text=With some study I have found a way to morph the elemental crystals to my own design. With this in mind I should be able to craft tools from them like I do with the other materials of this world.
res14.text=My studies have lead me to believe that I may be able to harness this energy within myself for the fabrication of new items perhaps as a power source of some kind.
res15.text=These crystals seem to be important more so than I had originally thought if my hypothesis is correct... I should be able to use my forge to make more of them. This may be expensive but its much faster than travelling for ages.
res16.text=Sometimes when I gaze into my interface I feel almost as though something within is watching me... Who are they?
res17.text=Using these complex materials that I have developed using my forge I believe that I may be able to improve or upgrade the forge itself I am not sure of what it will do but I do hope it makes it faster.
res18.text=As I had originally hoped it seems that these crystals once attuned to an element can act as a sort of conduit for my aura this allows me to channel my energy through them to manipulate the world. I have also found that the effect is amplified by nearby materials capable of resonating so far all I have found is iron but I am sure that there is are more. Another thing is that the crystal can be unstable at times I would prefer to keep it far away from my person so I will probably consider attaching a staff pole to it.
res19.text=I was right! Turns out that there are other materials that can be used it seems gold is better than iron for the amplification of power. But with this increase in power I will need to use a stronger wood for the staff pole.
res20.text=Seems my forge will be very useful indeed my latest discovery has lead me to believe that the infused metal I make in the forge is even better than gold! I doubt that my current staff pole will suffice.
res21.text=I don't know why... but one night while dreaming I heard a voice saying a word Zaloweist Over and over until. I awoke. I began my investigation. It had no links to my research and I could not fathom what it would possibly mean as I grew frustrated I shouted the word to the heavens above to my surprise the sky clouded over and rain began to pour. A flash of light. A sharp pain. Lightning had struck and I was its target. As I nursed my wounds my mind felt open almost as if it had been freed from some invisible bounds that had been there before.
res22.text=It has become apparent to me that that this forge is extremely useful I almost feel like maybe I would be able to use the same process on fabric to improve it this I will have to try.
res23.text=I cannot believe that I did not think of this before! For some reason it seemed that the fabric was useless but it turns out that it responds to the crystals in some way in fact it seems to obtain new properties when in proximity to them I wonder if this will allow me to craft some armour from it?
res24.text=I cannot believe that I did not think of this before! For some reason it seemed that the fabric was useless but it turns out that it responds to the crystals in some way in fact it seems to obtain new properties when in proximity to them I wonder if this will allow me to craft some armour from it?

For some reason it seemed that the fabric was useless but it turns out that it responds to the crystals in some way in fact it seems to obtain new properties when in proximity to them I wonder if this will allow me to craft some armour from it?
res29.text=Science... so very dangerous but yet so useful I wish that perhaps it was possible to re-create some of the things that can be done with it. My latest discovery suggests that I may be able to increase the efficiency of ore extraction if I were to use some of my magic in the forge.
res30.text=This is interesting it seems that all objects in this world contain energy this energy is however un-attuned hence why I never noticed before I think I have found a way to manipulate it but it may require more specific study of each item at hand.
res31.text=I suppose that I should have seen this before... The metal I make with the forge can be used just like the material it is constructed from this is good to know and I am sure I will make use of it in the future.
res32.text=Turns out I was wrong, to assume that the gems would be different. It seems that just like the metal they can also be used just as their non magic counterparts can, interesting.
res33.text=It would seem that the Arcane Workbench can be improved in a similar fashion to the forge I am not sure of the benefits yet but I am fairly certain that it will be beneficial.
res34.text=It appears that this element can be attuned further now it seems that I am able to focus my efforts to control ice itself.
res35.text=It appears that this element can be attuned further now it seems that I am able to focus my efforts to control steam itself.
res36.text=It appears that this element can be attuned further with increased focus I can manipulate the lattice structure of metals allowing total control.
res37.text=It appears that this element can be attuned further with increased focus I can manipulate the organic structures within plants allowing total control.
res38.text=It appears that this element can be attuned further breaking the bonds of this realm I can increase the force of my fire greatly.
res39.text=It appears that this element can be attuned further I feel a flame within myself... what have I become?
res40.text=It appears that this element can be attuned further the wind feels strong enough to move one such as I.
res41.text=It appears that this element can be attuned further the wind feels strong enough to move others with greater effect than before.
res42.text=It appears that this element can be attuned further I feel a rage within my soul but it makes me stronger time to unleash my true potential!
res43.text=It appears that this element can be attuned further I feel a rage within my soul but I must not give in my mind may suppress it let us hope it holds.
res44.text=It appears that this element can be attuned further now I know what was missing... Now I can create temporary darkness to allow for more options.
res45.text=It appears that this element can be attuned further now I see it. Now I see everything! I feel the darkness within every living being! But wait! There is someone else? Who are they?
res46.text=My recent discoveries have shown that there are many ways to command the great powers of this world. Until now I could only think of one way but I hypothesise that with some care I may be able to construct some items that could better use the power within the attuned crystals I have been crafting.
res47.text=The thought came to me in a dream. Even now after my consideration it still seems strange. I fear that by doing this I may create some division between the elements and myself. this feels wrong but yet it seems important my mind is conflicted but if I am to obtain a higher level of power... this may be my chance. It is clear to me now that there is more to this world than I first thought it feels linear but also familiar... Did I do this already?
res48.text=It would seem that the flow of magic throughout the world is like a wave with this in mind I theorise that with the right focus I might be able to displace solid objects in space. I have seen the tall figures doing this often and I have them to thank for the idea.
res49.text=Perhaps I was wrong to so hastily use this idea it would seem that certain objects change when moved by the wave. I will need to be careful in case I lose something valuable. Regardless the items formed from the displacement do have a strange feel to them and may be useful in advancing my work.
res50.text=It seems that with the right amount of focus I can store another form of energy within the void using these strange crystals. I am not yet sure what the point of this is yet. But I believe that my other works can be enhanced in some way by this discovery.
res51.text=I have learned much from my encounter with Aer. I believe that with the right focus I can use those Void Crystals to construct powerful automatic devices. Perhaps it will also show me some new things entirely...
