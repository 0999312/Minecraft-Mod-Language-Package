$title 传送带
$recipe automation/rollers
传送带是最基本的物流方法，从 A 点移动到 B 点。但是不想其他模组的传送带，这些传送带是纯金属打造的（与屠宰牛群相比有可很大的改进）。落在它们上面的任何物品将简单地沿传送带的方向移动。
$end
$title 板条箱
$recipe automation/crate
板条箱可以用来存放物品。相较于箱子的 27 个物品槽，它只有 18 个物品槽。但是，它们彼此之间不会相互连接，让多个板条箱紧挨着放置在一起，你仍然可以一个一个的打开这些板条箱。
它们看起来也很漂亮。
$end
$title 缓存箱
$recipe automation/buffercrate
缓存箱与板条箱类似，但在自动化系统中，每个物品槽中的最后一个物品不会被抽取。这对于确保某些物品始终有存放空间是非常有用的。
$end
$title 风扇升降机
$recipe automation/fan
风扇升降机是向上运输物品的主要方法。当给它一个红石信号时，它将把它上面物品直接向上吹出，距离与接收到的红石信号强度相等。
$end
$title 升降机接收器
$recipe automation/liftreceiver
升降机接收器用于接收风扇升降机运输的物品，升降机接收器将进入其底部舱口的物品从其侧面仓库输出。
$title 脉冲活塞
$recipe automation/pulsepiston
脉冲活塞会将掉落在它前面的任何物品推送到前方的容器中。右键单击可以打开过滤器界面，类似于白名单，这使得它在传送带上分拣物品时非常有用。
通入红石信号将禁用它。
$end
$title 自动喷射器
$recipe automation/autopuller
自动喷射器会将与其输入端相邻的容器中的物品抽出，并放入与输出端相邻的容器中，如果输出端的容易已满或无法放入，或输出端没有容器存在，物品将直接以掉落物的形式丢到外面。
通入红石信号将禁用它。
$end
$title 插入舱口
$recipe automation/hatch
与自动喷射器相反，只要其相邻的容器中有空件，插入舱口就是将与其接触的物品放入相邻的容器中。
$end
$title 堆栈移动器
$recipe automation/stackmover
当给堆栈移动器一个红石信号时，它会尝试从其输入端的容器中抽取一组物品，将并入输出端的容器中。它只会抽取能够放入目标容器中的第一组物品。如果它的输出端没有相邻的容器，那么这组物品就会以掉落物的形式掉落到世界中。
$end
$title 过滤型堆栈移动器
$recipe automation/filtermover
一个升级版的堆栈移动器，它将带有一个过滤器用来指定要抽取的物品和数量。它对于精确的物品分配非常有用。它有两种模式，循环匹配和只匹配第一个。
$end
$title 巨量堆栈移动器
$recipe automation/bulkmover
这是对过滤型堆栈移动器的进一步升级，它不再将过滤器中的物品一组一组的抽取，而是尝试同时抽取过滤器中标识的所有物品。
$end
$title Mounted Drill
$recipe automation/blockbreaker
The Mounted Drill is a device that breaks the block directly in front of it. In pulse mode it does this upon receiving a Redstone signal, while in continuous mode it does this once per second unless receiving a Redstone signal. Shift-right-click it with a Monkey Wrench to switch modes.
$end
$title Item Redistributor
$recipe automation/itemredis
The Item Redistributor redirects items dropped into its top to one of its sides, according to a ratio specified by its GUI. You can also select whether to treat a stack as a single entity, or to split it.
$end
$title Sequential Placer
$recipe automation/sequenceplacer
The Sequence Placer has an internal storage of 18 blocks. It places one in front of it, in the order they are, each time it receives a Redstone signal.
$end
$title Inventory Sensor
$recipe automation/inventorysensor
The Inventory Sensor is a versatile way of detecting what is stored in a container. It has its own inventory in which you can specify which items to search for, and you can toggle Exactly/At Least, Match All/Any, and Use/Ignore Damage.
$end
$title Item Interceptor
$recipe automation/interceptor
The Item Interceptor is a powerful tool for farms and mob traps. Unless powered by a Redstone signal, it will grab all item entities created between 3 and 12 blocks away from it and store them in its internal inventory. Note that it cannot pick up items that are already in the world.
$end
$title Pipe
$recipe automation/pipe
Copper pipes are the primary method of moving liquids around. Thankfully, they don't seem to melt no matter how hot the fluid inside is.
They will not automatically pull liquid from anything; an Extraction Pump must be used to push fluids into them.
$end
$title Stationary Tank
$recipe automation/tankblock
These tanks can hold up to 24 buckets of liquid each and will automatically attempt to insert fluid into another tank below them, making it possible to stack them. A Redstone signal disables this behaviour.
Insertion and extraction can be done from any side; the textures just indicate stacking behaviour. Manual I/O with buckets is also possible.
$end
$title Extraction Pump
$recipe automation/fluidpuller
The Extraction Pump automatically pulls liquid from any tanks connected to its input and inserts it into other fluid-accepting blocks, usually pipes.
$end
$title Water Collector
$recipe automation/watercollector
If placed in a river or ocean, the Water Collector will provide a steady and endless supply of water to an Extraction Pump above it.
$end
$title Transport Rollers
$recipe automation/rollers
Transport Rollers are the most basic method of moving items from Point A to Point B. Unlike other models of conveyor belts, these are purely metallic (a great improvement over slaughtering hordes of cows). Any items that fall on top of them will simply be moved in the direction of the rollers.
$end
$title Crate
$recipe automation/crate
Crates can be used to store items. They only have 18 slots to the Chest's 27, but they do not connect, can be tiled infinitely and can still be accessed with a block above them.
They also look quite nice.
$end
$title Buffer Crate
$recipe automation/buffercrate
Buffer Crates are similar to Crates, but automation will never take the last item in a stack from them. This can be useful for making sure there is always space for certain items.
$end
$title Fan Lift
$recipe automation/fan
The Fan Lift is the main method of transporting items upwards. When given a Redstone signal, they will blow any items above them straight up by a distance equal to the received signal strength.
$end
$title Lift Receiver
$recipe automation/liftreceiver
Meant to be used with the Fan Lift, the Lift Receiver redirects any items entering its bottom hatch to its side one.
$end
$title Pulse Piston
$recipe automation/pulsepiston
The Pulse Piston will push any items dropped in front of it, into an inventory if there is one where they would be shoved. Right-clicking will open a filter to set which items should be pushed. This makes it extremely useful for separating items moving on Transport Rollers.
A Redstone signal disables it.
$end
$title Auto Puller
$recipe automation/autopuller
The Auto Puller automatically yanks items from an inventory adjacent to its input and puts them into the inventory at its output, or drops them into the world if the output is full or does not exist. A Redstone signal disables it.
$end
$title Insertion Hatch
$recipe automation/hatch
The opposite of the Auto Puller, the Insertion Hatch will put items that touch it into an adjacent inventory as long as there is space.
$end
$title Stack Mover
$recipe automation/stackmover
The Stack Mover, when given a Redstone signal, attempts to pull a single stack of items from an inventory on its input side and push it into the inventory on its output side. It always moves the first stack it finds that will fit into the target inventory. If there is no inventory adjacent to its output side, the stack is dropped into the world instead.
$end
$title Filtered Stack Mover
$recipe automation/filtermover
An upgraded Stack Mover that has a filter to specify exactly which items to move and how many. It is useful for precise item allocation. It has two modes, Round Robin and First Match.
$end
$title Bulk Stack Mover
$recipe automation/bulkmover
A further upgrade to the Filtered Stack Mover. Instead of moving one stack of items in its filter, it will attempt to move everything in its filter at once.
$end
$title Mounted Drill
$recipe automation/blockbreaker
The Mounted Drill is a device that breaks the block directly in front of it. In pulse mode it does this upon receiving a Redstone signal, while in continuous mode it does this once per second unless receiving a Redstone signal. Shift-right-click it with a Monkey Wrench to switch modes.
