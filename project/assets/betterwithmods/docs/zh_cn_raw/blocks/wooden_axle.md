![Wooden Axle](block:betterwithmods:wooden_axle@0)

木制传动轴用于连通[变速箱](wooden_gearbox.md)，二者配合传递机械动力。

这种木质，用绳索捆扎的传动轴只能连接3格的距离，否则就会在压力之下破坏掉。再远的距离则需要连接变速箱。多个变速箱和传动轴配合来远程传输机械动力。

传动轴也是用来放置[风车]和[水车]的必要设备。

; The Wooden Axle is used to transfer continuous mechanical power in conjunction with [Gearbox](wooden_gearbox.md).
; 
; These wood and rope devices are only able to handle 3 blocks in a row before breaking under the stress.
; This is where Gearboxes come into play, allowing junctioning and repeating the signal from the Axle.
; 
; Axles are also where [Windmills] and [Waterwheels] are placed to begin creating Mechanical Power
