# Bellows

![Bellows](block:betterwithmods:bellows)

Bellows是一个气囊，当给予机械动力时，它会收缩并朝着它所面向的方向吹出一阵风。直到停止机械动力为止它都不会收回，这可以通过发送红石信号到某个[Gearbox](wooden_gearbox.md)来完成。
;The Bellows is an air blade, that when given mechanical power will contract and blow a gust of air in the direction it is facing. It will not retracted until the mechanical power is disabled, this can be done by sending a redstone signal to a [Gearbox](wooden_gearbox.md) somewhere down the line.
Bellows产生的阵风能够为火焰鼓风，但是正常的火源会被吹灭。为了解决这个问题，使用[Hibachi](hibachi.md)。
;The gust of air created by the Bellows is able to stoke fire, though normal fire sources are not strong enough to not be blown out. To solve this use a [Hibachi](hibachi.md).

另外，Bellows能够吹动它前面的物品。不同重量的物品会被吹动不同的距离。
 * 非常轻的物品，如灰尘，羽毛和纸将移动Bellows4格。
 * 中等重量的物品，例如种子，Hemp和Ground Netherrack会移动3格。
 * 重物品（或不知道的物品）会移动1格。

;Additonally, the Bellows is able to blow around items that are in front of it. Items of different weights will go different distances.
; * Very light items, such as Dusts, Feathers and Papers will go 4 blocks away from the bellows.
;   
; * Medium weight items, such as Seeds, Hemp products and Ground Netherrack will go 3 blocks.
;   
; * Heavy items (or items that are not known), will go 1 block.
