# Crucible

![Crucible](block:betterwithmods:cooking_pot@0)

Crucible是一个非常非常重要的锅，它是在一座Kiln中熔炼一个未烧制的坩埚而制作出来的。这个锅可以制造Soulforged Steel，并将工具和装甲熔炼成组件中，从而可以回收来自......刷怪塔......以及你已经使用了一段时间的装甲/工具。
; The Crucible is a very, very important crafting pot, created from smelting an unfired crucible in a Kiln. This pot enables the creation of Soulforged Steel and the smelting of manufactured tools and armor down into their components, enabling recycling from say... Mob traps. Or nearly-broken armor/tools you've been using for a while now.

Crucible也是独一无二的，它的大部分功能都都需要使用鼓风的猛焰。正如你在窑炉里用猛火制造了Crucible，你已经知道如何获得这种蓝色的火焰，所以这里不再重复。
; The Crucible is also unique in that the majority of it's functionality is locked behind having a steady stoked flame. As you will have made the Crucible with a stoked flame in the Kiln, you will likely know how to maintain a stoked flame from that experience, so this will not be repeated here.

就像它的铁制兄弟一样，[Cauldron](block:betterwithmods:cooking_pot@1)，坩埚可以从3x3的区域内吸收热量。关于这个的细节在这个Cauldron的条目中被讨论过，但为了清楚起见，这里将重复这些内容，并且不必再单击更多的内容：
 * 需要直接在它下面的火。
 * 围绕着火焰的3x3的环中的火焰都在Crucible下面。
 * 如果您使用的是火焰，那么请确保火源来自Hibachi，否则火势将被吹熄。
; Like it's iron brother, the [Cauldron](block:betterwithmods:cooking_pot@1), the Crucible benefits from having more fire underneth it in a 3x3 area. The details on that are talked about on it's page, but will be repeated here for clarity and having to save you from clicking more:
; * Needs a fire directly under it.
; * Each additional fire in the 3x3 ring surrounding the fire underneth the Crucible.
; * If you're using stoked fire, then make sure the fire sources come from Hibachis, or else the fire will get blown out.

# Uses for a Crucible without stoked fire under it:
* You can dry a sponge out without having to go to the Nether. If you have a bucket in the crucible as it dries out, you'll get a bucket of water. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

# Uses for a Crucible with stoked fire under it:
* Creation of Soulforged Steel, utilizing a Soul Urn, Coal/Charcoal Dust, an Iron Ingot, and Soul Flux.
* 100% return ratio for recycling Diamond/Soulforged Steel tools, armors, and weapons
* 66% return ratio for every other metal's tools, armors, and weapons (This 66% is the default, and may have been changed by the modpack author, if this mod was included in a modpack.)
* Mass smelting of cobblestone and sand into stone and glass, respectively. This saves you on fuel costs in the furnace MASSIVELY.
* Recycling tons of other metal stuff, also at a 66% return ratio, but with a mostly lossless conversion rate for some stuff.
* Compressing nuggets into ingots, mainly for use with the above reycling factors, and also mob farms. Supports most modded ingots if they have a nugget form they break down into.
* Other mods, such as Better With Addons, may add additional recipes and uses for the stoked crucible!
