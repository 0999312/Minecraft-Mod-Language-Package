# 坩埚

![坩埚](block:betterwithmods:cooking_pot@0)

坩埚是一个非常非常重要的锅，它是在一座窑中熔炼一个未烧制的坩埚而制作出来的。这个锅可以制造熔魂钢，并将工具和装甲熔炼成组件，从而可以回收来自......刷怪塔......以及你已经使用了一段时间的装甲/工具。

坩埚也是独一无二的，它的大部分功能都都需要使用鼓风的猛焰。正如你在窑炉里用猛焰制造了坩埚，你已经知道如何获得这种蓝色的火焰，所以这里不再重复。

就像它的铁制兄弟[釜锅](block:betterwithmods:cooking_pot@1)一样，坩埚可以从3x3的区域内吸收热量。关于这个的细节在釜锅的条目中被讨论过，但为了清楚起见，这里将重复这些内容，你不必再点击更多的内容：
 * 坩埚需要它正下方有火焰。
 * 围绕着中心火焰的3x3的环中的火焰都在坩埚下方。
 * 如果你使用的是猛焰，那么请确保火源来自火盆，否则火势可能被吹熄。

# Uses for a 坩埚 without stoked fire under it:
* You can dry a sponge out without having to go to the Nether. If you have a bucket in the crucible as it dries out, you'll get a bucket of water. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

# Uses for a 坩埚 with stoked fire under it:
* Creation of 熔魂钢, utilizing a 灵魂陶瓮, Coal/木炭粉, an Iron Ingot, and 灵魂助溶剂.
* 100% return ratio for recycling Diamond/熔魂钢 tools, armors, and weapons
* 66% return ratio for every other metal's tools, armors, and weapons (This 66% is the default, and may have been changed by the modpack author, if this mod was included in a modpack.)
* Mass smelting of cobblestone and sand into stone and glass, respectively. This saves you on fuel costs in the furnace MASSIVELY.
* Recycling tons of other metal stuff, also at a 66% return ratio, but with a mostly lossless conversion rate for some stuff.
* Compressing nuggets into ingots, mainly for use with the above reycling factors, and also mob farms. Supports most modded ingots if they have a nugget form they break down into.
* Other mods, such as Better With Addons, may add additional recipes and uses for the stoked crucible!
