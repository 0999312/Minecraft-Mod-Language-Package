signals.tooltip.item.rail_network_controlle=Shows an overview of the rail network of the world you are currently in. \n \nLeft clicking a signal forces it to turn green. \nRight clicking a signal forces it to go red.
signals.tooltip.item.cart_engin=Sneak-right-click with this on any cart. This will add a solid-fueled motor to the cart. Additionally, the engine is clever, meaning that it will automatically stop at red signals, without requiring powered rails, for instance.
signals.tooltip.item.rail_configurato=This item is required for most interaction in Signals. Additionally it will show some information about the rail network. \n \nRight click carts to define destinations. \nRight click inventories to define filter matching behaviour when adjacent to Station Markers.
