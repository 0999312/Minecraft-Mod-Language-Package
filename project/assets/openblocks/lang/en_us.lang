openblocks.gui.welcome.titl=Welcome!
openblocks.gui.welcome.conten=OpenBlocks is a new open source mod that introduces a variety of ideas into Minecraft, including hang gliders, elevators, tanks, graves, paints, cranes, liquid XP, cartographers, trophies and more!


openblocks.gui.credits.titl=Credits
openblocks.gui.credits.conten=§LBoq, Mikee and NeverCast§R - Leading developers of OpenBlocks (are we allowed to credit ourselves?)\n\n§LSinZ and Yoshi2§R - members of the OpenMods team from the start.\n\n§LVexatos and crafteverywhere§R - Regularly translating the mods.\n\nEveryone else who has contributed to the code over the past two years.\n\n§LDirewolf20 and the rest of ForgeCraft§R - for putting up with the bugs and crashes before we release.\n\nEveryone who's done spotlights, lets plays and generally supported the mod since we started!


openblocks.gui.config.titl=Easy Config Editing
openblocks.gui.config.conten=OpenMods allow for both client and server config options to be changed from chat commands. Some don't even require restart!\n\nServer config settings can be changed using '§L/om_config_s§R' (op needed) and client config settings can be changed using '§L/om_config_c§R'\n\nFor example:\n\n§L/om_config_s set OpenBlocks dropblock elevatorDrainsXP false§R\n§L/om_config_s save§R\n\nFor a full list of commands type: §L/help om_config_s§R or §L/help om_config_c§R


openblocks.gui.restore_inv.titl=Inventory backup
openblocks.gui.restore_inv.conten=Everyone can make mistake. But with §L/ob_inventory§R command you can fix some of them. This command can be used to restore inventory. Backup is created when:\n - player dies\n - grave is spawned \n - player issued command §L/ob_inventory store§R\n\nTo restore inventory you need backup name. Go to folder below or to saves folder on server and look for files named §Linventory-*.dat§R. Then restore inventory with §L/ob_inventory restore <player> <id>§R - where id is either full filename or just middle part, without §Linventory-§R and §L.dat§R. You can also use tab completion. Backups are normal NBT files and can be opened with any editor.


openblocks.gui.bkey.titl=The Infamous 'B' Key
openblocks.gui.bkey.conten=The 'B' key is a very special key in OpenBlocks.\n\nEnabling the 'weAreSeriousPeople' config option in the 'tomfoolery' category of both the client and server config files will give you your very own digestive system.\n\nTry eating some of that tasty clay and press 'B' to digest!


openblocks.gui.unstable.titl=Unstable Enchantment
openblocks.gui.unstable.conten=We've had unconfirmed reports that this enchantment causes any gunpowder you're carrying to become unstable when you're attacked or when you jump off something.\n\nUse at your own risk!


openblocks.gui.flimflam.titl=Flim Flam Enchantment
openblocks.gui.flimflam.conten=Scientists have yet to discover the properties of this enchantment.


openblocks.gui.laststand.titl=Last Stand Enchantment
openblocks.gui.laststand.conten=The last stand enchantment uses your XP bar as a final protection against dying.\n\nWhen you reach 0.5 hearts, the game will take XP from you whenever you're damaged instead of killing you. The higher number of enchantments you have the cheaper the XP cost will be.
