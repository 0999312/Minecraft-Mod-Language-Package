research.ALUMENTUM.stage.1=Nitor is a useful substance. It provides heat, light and is aesthetically pleasing. Unfortunately it provides only slightly more heat than a torch - enough to slowly heat some water or keep you warm at night, but not enough for practical purposes like smelting ore.<BR>I need something more... reactive.<BR>I should take some time to collect my thoughts and study the elements. Maybe there is a way to improve coal like I did glowstone.
research.ALUMENTUM.stage.2=I was right! I should be able to take a lump of coal and add more of the essentia it already contains... and possibly a little bit of perditio for extra kick.<BR>If my calculations are correct the resulting substance, which I have called Alumentum, should burn three times longer than normal coal.<BR>My calculations also show that the substance will be quite energetic and I should take care not to chuck it about... not unless I have good reason to, that is.
research.ALUMENTUM.title=Alumentum
research.ARCANESPA.stage.1=I have created a handy machine that when filled with water and bath salts will automatically mix them and pump the liquid into an area above it. The liquid will fill a 5x5 area above the location where the machine is placed.<BR>Additionally, I have designed it in such a way that it can be used to pump nearly any liquid I can fill it with. It can be filled with with automation, or by clicking on the block with the appropriate container. Applying a redstone signal will disable it.
research.ARCANESPA.title=Arcane Spa
research.BASEALCHEMY.stage.1=Crucible crafting guide<BR>1) Place crucible over heat source (fire, lava, nitor or something similar).<BR>2) Add water and wait till it boils.<BR>3) Add ingredients with the essentia you require, either by dropping them in or clicking with the item on the crucible's top face<BR>4) Throw in catalyst.<PAGE>Things to note<BR>- Shift-right clicking with an empty hand will empty a crucible.<BR>- Each crafting operation will consume some of the water so I will have to replenish it now and again. Piping mechanics can be used for this.<BR>- I can craft multiple items at once by adding sufficient essentia and using multiple catalysts.<BR>- Essentia does dissolve over time so I shouldn't wait too long before starting to craft. I wonder what the purple puffs of smoke means when this happens? Probably nothing to worry about.<LINE>Crafting Crystals<BR>Essentia crystals should be fairly easy to craft. All I need to do is break down a quartz crystal into smaller shards to act as a growth medium.<BR>Simply dipping a shard into the crucible should soak up some of the essentia it contains and cause the crystal to grow.<BR>This won't be a particularly efficient way of doing things - it will probably cost at least twice the essentia that the crystal will end up containing and there is the net loss of quartz which is not always the easiest thing to find.  I'm also not sure I will be able to control exactly what essentia gets crystalised.
research.BASEALCHEMY.title=Basic Alchemy
research.BASEARTIFICE.stage.1=I am now ready to begin crafting enchanted objects and tools - I just need to think of some to make.<BR>Time to get to work.
research.BASEARTIFICE.title=Basic Artifice
research.BATHSALTS.stage.1=Warp is a danger for even the most careful of thaumaturges. For those that have done a bit too much dabbling Warp effects are probably more than just an annoyance.<BR>I should make solving this problem a priority. Even if I am not able to remove Warp, at the very least I should be able to alleviate it's effects.
research.BATHSALTS.stage.2=I have drawn up a recipe to create relaxing and refreshing bath salts. Simply tossing these salts into water will turn the water into a silvery, purifying liquid that soothes away the stresses of the day and brings temporary relief from the effects of Warp. I should note however that the more warp a thaumaturge suffers from, the shorter the duration of this protection.<BR>The salts are quite fragile and will soon dissolve if tossed around haphazardly.
research.BATHSALTS.title=Purifying Bath Salts
research.BOTTLETAINT.stage.1=I should be able to replicate the Taint causing properties of flux. I am not exactly sure why I would want to, but sometimes progress requires risk.<BR>The process should be fairly simple - I merely need to create a concentrated mixture of flux and it should easily react with almost anything to create Taint.
research.BOTTLETAINT.title=Bottled Taint
research.BrainyZombie.stage.1=I have observed that some zombies seem much more aware than their lumbering brethren. Their eyes burn with a malevolent intelligence leading me to believe that they retained much more intelligence after death than is normal. They are definitely more aggressive and dangerous than a normal zombie.<BR>They should make good sources of brain matter for my experiments.
research.CrimsonCultist.stage.1=These red-robed cultists have been popping up of late. Their goals are unknown to me and they seem unwilling to talk. They seem wrong somehow. Their grip on sanity seems tenuous at best, but the wrongness goes much deeper than that. It is hard to describe.<BR>My presence seems to enrage them and I believe it might have something to do with my capacity for thaumaturgy.<BR>Their clerics are also capable of wielding magic and I can sense that they are drawing it from the aura, but the magic itself does not seem to be thaumaturgy. Whatever it is, it makes my skin crawl and I can feel the aura buckling and tearing every time they draw upon it.<BR>Some of them seem to carry a book around. I should try and get my hand on one of those, maybe it will tell me more about this strange cult. I should be careful though, some knowledge can be dangerous.
research.CrimsonCultist.title=The Crimson Cult
research.ESSENTIASMELTER.stage.1=I see a time fast approaching where I will need to have ready access to multiple different kinds of essentia. For that I will need a source and the most obvious is the essentia found in, well, everything.<BR>Using alchemical principles should be able to find a way to break down objects and convert them into essentia. Before I can start however I will need to study essentia in the purest form available to me - vis crystals.<BR>By subjecting these crystals to, um, "destructive testing" I should be able to determine how they react in various extremes and the best way to preserve their purity.<BR>I should start with primal Essentia.
research.ESSENTIASMELTER.stage.2=My experiments are promising if a bit unpredictable. Fortunately the fires where easily quenched and my hair should grow back in a few days.<BR>It seems melting objects down in a special alchemical process is my best option. Unfortunately my tests so far has been on primal crystals. I should also test my finding on crystals containing secondary essentia - that is essentia made up of a combination of two primal aspects.<BR>A third tier known as tertiary essentia also exists. That is essentia made up of a mixture of primal and secondary aspects, or two secondary aspects.
research.ESSENTIASMELTER.stage.3=I have managed to break down all my samples of primary and secondary essentia into a liquid state. The process has been slow and tedious however. Until I simplify the process it will never be practical for large scale usage.<BR>Luckily extracting essentia from objects has a lot in common with the smelting of metals. Using a furnace as a base I might be able to create an essentia smeltery that automatically melts down items and separates out individual types of essentia.
research.ESSENTIASMELTER.stage.4=I have drawn up the plans for an Essentia Smelter. The smelter works much like a normal furnace by burning coal to produce heat, but instead of smelting ore into metal, it breaks down objects into a slurry of raw, unprocessed essentia. This process isn't very efficient and a small amount of essentia is converted into flux roughly 20% of the time.<BR>The next step in the process is to take the essentia slurry and distill it using an Arcane Alembic.<BR>To work, arcane alembics need to be placed on top of a smelter. Multiple alembics can be placed on top of each other to increase storage, but it does not influence processing speed. The essentia slurry will slowly be drawn into the alembic and the individual aspected essentia separated out.<BR>If the smelter is being powered by alumentum, this distillation process is much faster.<BR>The essentia can then be extracted out of an alembic using phials, jars or more complex means.<BR>Bellows placed on the side of a smelter will greatly increase the heat it generates, allowing items to be broken down into a slurry much quicker.

research.EldritchCrab.stage.1=Eldritch Crabs or Helmed Crabs are a most unusual and unnatural creature. I am convinced these creatures are the result of magical tinkering.<BR>A pair of powerful claws make them dangerous to face in combat, but it is how they use those claws that make them horrific. They leap at their foes heads in an attempt to decapitate them. If successful they are somehow able to burrow into the victims body and take control of what remains. Their abdomen looks much like a helmed head allowing them to disguise the true nature of the husk they now control.<BR>These husks are not much more powerful than a normal zombie so the reason why they do this eludes me - they are much more of a threat without their 'mount'. Possibly they were created as weapons of terror by some demented inventor?
research.EldritchGuardian.stage.1=These ghost-like figures are a dangerous menace. They can be found wherever the walls of reality are at their thinnest. I believe they act as guardians of such places, protecting those weak spots from trespassers.<BR>Their form is held together by dimensional energies from some other place making them much weaker in our world. I would hate having to confront them in whatever place they call home.<BR>Their touch is deadly and they are able to hurl entropic dimensional energy at those too far to reach.
research.FIRSTSTEPS.stage.1=Who would have thought that a few sprinkles of dust could have created this marvelous book? It is mostly blank, but it hints at a powerful new form of magic: Thaumaturgy.<BR>Firstly I will need to study the magical world that has been shown to me. For that I will need a tool - a Thaumometer the book calls it.<BR>A normal crafting table won't do however since the magical energies I need to channel while crafting it are quite delicate. A sprinkling of Salis Mundus on a mundane crafting table should solve that. The book has taught me the proper incantation to use so it should be a simple matter.<BR>To keep myself on track I will make note of all my required goals on the first page of every project.
research.FIRSTSTEPS.stage.2=Progress! I now have an Arcane Workbench at my disposal. It works much like a mundane crafting table and can even be used as such, however there are a few key differences.<BR>Firstly, many arcane recipes will require the use of those vis crystals I've been finding of late. They act as a focus for the magical energy I need to channel into the items I craft. The book calls this magical energy Vis.<BR>Supposedly this energy is all around me, but as yet I cannot perceive or measure it.<BR>It is time I craft the Thaumometer and use it to study the world around me. It should clearly mark those things I still need to examine.<BR>I have placed a bookmark to the Thaumometer recipe on the right.
research.FIRSTSTEPS.stage.3=Such strange wonders are being revealed to me. Peering through the lens of the Thaumometer shows me a world coursing with magic, Vis as the books calls it.<BR>Normally this energy is a pure ocean of magic that ebbs and flows, but it also permeates all things, both animate and inanimate. The books calls Vis in this state Essentia. Where Vis is formless and pure, Essentia is more rigid in its nature and falls into a multitude of clearly defined types, each mixing together with others to form greater and more complex types of essentia.<BR>I am not quite sure if the matter it is bound to gives Essentia its nature, or that the very nature of matter depends on the Essentia it contains. This bears further study.<BR>I am keeping a log of all the types of essentia I discover. A bookmark on the left will show my current knowledge.<BR>For now I need to focus my energies elsewhere - three paths have opened before me. Which will I take first?
research.FIRSTSTEPS.title=First Steps
research.FLUX.stage.1=I have been monitoring a strange buildup of magical energy in the aura. It seems to be a form of 'dirty' vis that I have named Flux. It shows as an ominous dark bar on my thaumometer.<BR>I now know what those purple puffs are I occasionally see when I am being careless - it is essentia spilling into the atmosphere and becoming Flux. Pure essentia, it seems, should not be directly exposed to the aura.<BR>I'm not exactly sure what negative effects this will cause, but I have noticed that Flux seems to clog the local aura preventing Vis from replenishing naturally.<BR>Picture it as a thick layer of scum on a natural pool of clean water.<BR>The local aura has a point at which it is 'filled' and Flux seems to count towards this capacity.<BR>More alarmingly, it seems to take precedence over vis and I suspect it can probably exceed this natural limit. I am not sure what will happen when Flux overflows.
research.FLUX.stage.2=Note to self: Do NOT let the flux build. It is bad.<BR>Very, very bad.<BR>If Flux builds high enough it seem to cause a tear in the very fabric of magic itself. The flux escapes through this tear, but usually raw, chaotic magic spills through into our world causing all manner of calamity.<BR>I should be a lot more careful of causing flux in the future. In fact, i should start looking into ways to neutralise Flux.
research.FLUX.title=Flux
research.FLUX.warn=Something seems to be building up in the aura. Something bad.
research.FOCUSBOLT.stage.1=Hurling magical projectiles is a chore sometimes. They are hard to aim and take time to travel to the intended target.<BR>Hurling bolts of magical energy will be much better. They will effect their target instantly and aiming will also be a lot easier. Unfortunately I will probably have to expend a lot more vis to do so, but it will be worth it.
research.FOCUSBOLT.stage.2=The way my bolts function has more than just cosmetic similarities to natural lightning. I may also be able to duplicate the ability of lightning to arc between nearby targets. Each individual bolt in the chain will be weaker and more expensive, but the ability to effect multiple similar targets with a single cast will be priceless.
research.FOCUSBOLT.title=Focus Medium: Bolt
research.FOCUSBREAK.stage.1=Calling up the destructive power of perditio I should be able to design a pattern that can be used to safely break most blocks.
research.FOCUSBREAK.stage.2=There is a enchantment that allows you to break blocks without actually breaking them - instead they retain their unbroken form.<BR>By studying this 'Silk Touch' Enchantment I might be able to replicate this as a focus pattern.
research.FOCUSBREAK.title=Focus Effect: Break
research.FOCUSCURSE.stage.1=The pech wand I discovered is strange and unusable, but its workings bear some striking similarities to thaumaturgical foci.<BR>I should be able to reverse engineer it.
research.FOCUSCURSE.stage.2=As I suspected the pech wand is thaumaturgical in nature. Unfortunately this discovery leaves me with more questions than answers.<BR>At least I was able to decipher the wands magic into a usable focus pattern. The Curse pattern magically cripples and poisons anything it hits. It even curses the target with a streak of bad luck. Quite nasty and probably devastating if combined with other effects.
research.FOCUSCURSE.title=Focus Effect: Curse
research.FOCUSEXCHANGE.stage.1=While teleportation magic is a beyond me at the moment, my studies of the permutatio aspect leads me to believe that I should be able to make physical objects swap positions.<BR>I should see if my theory holds any water.
research.FOCUSEXCHANGE.stage.2=My theory has proven correct! By applying this pattern to a focus I can use it to select a type of block in the world. I simply need to sneak while right-clicking on it.<BR>When I then cast the effect on most other blocks it will exchange the target block for the one I selected earlier. Obviously I must be carrying enough of the selected blocks for the exchange to happen and the targeted block (or what it normally drops when broken) will appear in my inventory.<BR>It seems I cannot exchange particularly complex blocks, or those that cannot be broken by normal means.<BR>Apart from the cost to cast it, it seems the vis cost is also subtracted for each block exchanged in this way. I should be cautious.
research.FOCUSEXCHANGE.title=Focus Effect: Exchange
research.FOCUSPROJECTILE.stage.1=Touching my foe to set them alight is fine and all, but I would much rather hurl magic at them from afar. I need to find a way to extend focal energy beyond my limited reach.
research.FOCUSPROJECTILE.stage.2=A single projectile is fine and all, but what if I could hurl multiple projectiles at once? Splitting the magical energy in this way will make each individual projectile weaker and less accurate, but the gain in area covered and foes slain should more than make up for it.
research.FOCUSPROJECTILE.title=Focus Medium: Projectile
research.FOCUSRIFT.stage.1=I have performed a few tentative experiments with dimensional magic. Thusfar I have had mixed results, but I am able to reliably shift inanimate matter into an adjacent reality while part of that reality shifts into ours.<BR>I think. Either way, the matter returns unharmed almost every time. Living matter is a different matter - I dare not pen what I saw and I doubt I will attempt that experiment again.<BR>Luckily I think I will be able to replicate this discovery in the form a focus effect. Most inanimate objects will be shifted into this other realm temporarily like some sort of portable hole.<BR>The diameter of this hole will remain fixed at around 3 yards, but I should be able to manipulate the depth a bit. Normally it should be around 8 yards.
research.FOCUSRIFT.title=Focus Effect: Rift
research.Firebat.stage.1=Fire bats, or Hellbats are usually found in the Nether. Engulfed in flame and unreasonably aggressive they are perfectly suited to the environment they live in. They also have the alarming tendency to explode when attacking.<BR>One wonders what possible evolutionary advantage exploding gives them as a species, but the same can be asked of creepers.
research.HEDGEALCHEMY.stage.1=It should be a fairly simple process to apply the alchemical principles I've learned to creating common materials.<BR>It will hardly be a challenge for me, but the practice should do me good.<BR>I realised that I have gathered an alarmingly large stock of rotten flesh for who knows what reason. Maybe it is time I put it to use and render it into tallow. It should be handy for crafting candles if nothing else.<BR>I should also be able to turn it into leather with a little bit of magical elbow grease.
research.HEDGEALCHEMY.stage.2=Some substances are simple enough that just adding more of the same essentia it contains is enough to create more of that substance. This isn't true for everything, but the phenomenon will probably prove useful.
research.HEDGEALCHEMY.stage.3=Some things you simply have to craft from scratch - all I need is a base material to add essentia to and with a bit of luck I can manufacture a few relatively common, but annoying to get materials.
research.HEDGEALCHEMY.stage.4=For now my studies are complete, but who knows what other wondrous discoveries I will make in the future?
research.HEDGEALCHEMY.title=Hedge Alchemy
research.KNOWLEDGETYPES.stage.1=There are several different types of knowledge... [to be completed once everything is done]
research.KNOWLEDGETYPES.title=Types of Knowledge
research.LIQUIDDEATH.stage.1=Curiosity has taken me down a dark path. I wonder what a liquid made mostly from entropic and death energy would do. Nothing good I imagine.<BR>At the very least it should make a handy weed killer or control pests.
research.LIQUIDDEATH.stage.2=Oh dear, what have I done? This liquid is so dangerously toxic that virtually nothing can prevent it from dissolving flesh, bone and even harder substances. Nothing alive or that even displays the semblance of life can survive it.<BR>Apart from obvious practical applications, this vile substance has another interesting property: Any essentia a dissolved creature possessed form into crystals that can be harvested.
research.LIQUIDDEATH.title=Liquid Death
research.METALLURGY.stage.1=Brass is a sturdy, low friction metal perfectly suited to craft intricate mechanical devices.<BR>Unfortunately it is not always possible to get hold of it due to the morphic properties of the universe I may find myself in.<BR>There should be a way of crafting it via alchemical transmutation. I simply need to find it.
research.METALLURGY.stage.2=Metals have proven to be quite easy to manipulate via thaumaturgical principles. My first experiments has led to the discovery of Alchemical Brass, but it was a simple matter to create something that already exists. It is time to create something new.<BR>I have theorized that by infusing a base metal like iron with magical energy should result in something with very interesting properties.<BR> It should be harder than iron with the ability to accept enchantments beyond that which iron is normally capable of.<BR>A metal such as this should have many applications in the crafting of more advanced thaumaturgical devices.
research.METALLURGY.stage.3=I am sure I am on the edge of a breakthrough here, but I have no idea how to proceed. There is something missing, some vital piece of information I lack.<BR>I should proceed carefully however. Somehow I sense the areas of knowledge I am delving into now could be dangerous.
research.METALLURGY.stage.4=My hand shakes as I write this. The strange substances I have investigated has opened strange new vistas in my mind.<BR>Before me I have formulas for creating a mysterious new metal, yet I do not remember writing them, nor does the handwriting look quite like mine.<BR>The metal they describe is a mass of contradictions. It is hard and unyielding, yet at the same time soft and easy to work. It will feel warm to the touch, almost alive and like living things it will slowly heal itself if damaged.<BR>Crafting mere physical tools from this seems almost... wrong.
research.METALLURGY.stage.5=For now my studies are complete, but who knows what other wondrous discoveries I will make in the future?
research.METALLURGY.title=Alchemical Metallurgy
research.METALPURIFICATION.stage.1=Native clusters are rare concentrations of metals in its purest form. When smelted these clusters produces twice the normal amount of ingots.<BR>If I can find a way of producing native clusters alchemically it would greatly reduce my need to constantly go mining.
research.METALPURIFICATION.title=Metal Purification
research.Pech.stage.1=These strange humanoids can be found wherever the veil between worlds is at its thinnest. They seem drawn to the magical energies that abound in such places.<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/research/research5.png:128:136:108:117:.75</IMG>Don't let their small stature fool you. They have incredible strength and can carry many times their own bodyweight.<BR>Pech are normally not aggressive, but when riled up they will band together and hunt down their attacker. Under normal conditions they avoid people at all costs.<BR>Pechs are notoriously avaricious, and will loot anything not nailed down, though they prefer precious things. It is said that if you feed this desire for material wealth it could be possible to befriend one.<BR>Once befriended they often carry wondrous objects that they might be willing to part with.<BR>It should be noted that such 'friendships' seldom last long.
research.Pech.title=The Pech
research.SANESOAP.stage.1=I seem to have stumbled upon something here. Bath Salts relax the body and brings temporary relief from Warp, but I need a more permanent solution. Something that will cleanse my body of Warp completely.<BR>Sympathetic magic could come in handy here. Soap cleanses the body, but with the proper amount of persuasion maybe it can cleanse the mind as well?
research.SANESOAP.stage.2=Eureka! I have formulated a recipe for what I have named Sanity Soap (patent pending)<BR>This soap cleans the flesh, but the effects it has on the psyche is what truly makes it special. When used it has a small chance of reducing non-permanent warp and will remove all temporary warp.<BR>Using it while under the effects of a Warp Ward or while standing in Purifying Fluid will increase your odds.
research.SANESOAP.title=Sanity Soap
research.THEORYRESEARCH.stage.1=For me to make any progress as a thaumaturge I cannot rely on simply studying the world around me or stumbling upon ancient knowledge. I will need to make my own discoveries and expand my knowledge through experimentation. Crafting my own theories is the only way.<BR>I will need to create a comfortable workspace to do my research with ample supplies like writing materials and paper. I should craft a some scribing tools and place it upon a table.
research.THEORYRESEARCH.stage.2=Now that I have a workspace I should start performing some research.<BR>By studying how aspects fit together I can formulate theories on how to manipulate magic to my own ends.<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/research/research2.png:96:152:160:104:.8</IMG>On the top left of the research table screen there are two slots, one for scribing tools and the other for paper. Ever time  I begin to research it will cost ink and paper. All actions taken during research will also cost some ink.<BR>Next to the paper is a green button that will start the research process. You can press it again at any time to reset your current research and start from scratch (costing both ink and paper).<BR>Once you start the research process the space below the ink and paper will show you all the aspects you have available. This is called the aspect bank. At the start you will only have primal aspects in the bank, but by clicking on them you may combine them to form more complex aspects.<BR>Each time you begin research you will have a finite amount of aspects - once they run out you must make do with what you have left, or start over from scratch.<BR>On the right of the table is a large area that will display your current research. When you begin research it will display a hexagonal grid with all the primal aspects randomly spread around the outer edge. You can drag aspects from your bank into any blank hex. Clicking on a placed aspect will permanently delete it permanently - it will not be return to the bank. <BR>The premise to complete a research is quite simple in practice, but getting exactly the results you want is much more complex. Firstly research is completed once all 6 the primal aspects are linked together. This is done by placing other aspects next to them, but the only aspects that will form a link are those that make up a part of the aspect they are trying to link to.<BR>For example Ignem and Terra will not form a link as the one does not form the part of the other, however Ignem and Potentia will form a link as Ignem is one of the components of Potentia, the other being Ordo.<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/research/research2.png:128:0:128:119:.8</IMG><BR>All the primal aspects don't need to be linked to each other primal - they only need to form part of the linked whole.<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/research/research6.png:0:0:255:255:.5</IMG>Once all the primals have been linked, a button will appear in the bottom right allowing you to turn the theory into knowledge you can use for research. Forming a complete theory is, however, only half of what you need to do.<LINE>As you progress through the linking process you will see numbers appear on the right of the screen next to a research category. That is the amount of progress you will gain if you complete this theory. Fractions are kept track of so if you complete 1.4 of a theory point you will only need to complete .6 more to gain another full theory point. You gain progress in all the categories used in that theory, but the highest ranked category gets a significant bonus compared to the others.<BR>Each aspect is linked to one or more research categories and may count more towards one category than  another. For example praecantatio is linked to both Thaumaturgy and Alchemy, but it counts more towards Thaumaturgy than it does towards Alchemy.<BR>This means that by using more of a certain type of aspect than another when completing a theory you can determine which category will progress the most. It should be noted that there are diminishing returns in using a specific aspect more than once - in the above example you will get a major bonus to Thaumaturgy if you use praecantatio, but every time after the first you will get significantly smaller increases in your Thaumaturgy total. As a result you may want to try and determine what other aspects give Thaumaturgy increases and use them instead.<BR>The last way of gaining a bonus towards a specific category is the Bonus Hex. One of the blank hexes will be marked with a glowing spot. Any aspect placed in this hex will grant a significant bonus to categories it is associated with.
research.THEORYRESEARCH.title=Theorycrafting
research.TaintCrawler.stage.1=These disgusting grubs secrete corrupting Taint wherever they go. Most of the time the Taint is short-lived if they wander too far from the core of the Taint growth, but other times this can cause the Taint to spread much quicker than it normally would.<BR>It is best to destroy them on sight.
research.TaintSeed.stage.1=Occasionally tight knots of Tainted tendrils will form. From out of this 'seed' foul tainted air will spew which acts as the basis for new Taint growth.<BR>These seeds can lash out to defend themselves, but the risk must be taken if you wish to rid an area of taint.<BR>Without the foul air these seeds create, tainted growth soon withers and dies.
research.TaintSwarm.stage.1=Sometimes purple hive-like growths will form on the remains of trees within Taint. Swarms of tiny biting creatures will spawn from these growths and rove around in aggressive swarms.<BR>They move fast, are hard to avoid and even harder to hit. Fortunately the individual creatures are not particularly robust so a properly prepared traveller should be able to dispatch them easily.
research.Taintacle.stage.1=These dangerous growths look like giant tentacles. They will lash out at anything that comes nearby.<BR>Thought they are immobile keeping your distance might not keep you safe as miniature versions of them will spawn all around you should you draw their attention.
research.ThaumSlime.stage.1=These purple slimes are a strange offshoot of their green cousins. Normal slimes form from the organic gunk that occasionally collects in caves, but Thaumic Slimes are formed from the purple proto-matter residue left over from magical mishaps.<BR>Apart from their strange origins they are rather similar to their green cousins for the most part. They do appear to have the ability to split at will, often spitting a lesser version of themselves at targets that venture too close. If there are no targets nearby, split slimes will endeavour to reform to once again form a larger organism.
research.UNLOCKALCHEMY.stage.1=Brewing simple potions has its uses, but true alchemical interactions require more than mixing a few monster parts together.<BR>I think Essentia holds the key to a much more sophisticated way of manipulating matter.<BR>I should try and learn more about alchemy and how it fits into the magical world.<BR>Armed with that knowledge and a little bit of inspiration I am sure Thaumaturgic Alchemy will be within my grasp.
research.UNLOCKALCHEMY.stage.2=My recent discoveries have given me a new insight into how the world is put together and I think I might know a way to transform matter by altering its Essentia.<BR>This will require experimentation and something to hold the alchemical substrate. A simple brewing stand will not do - what I need is a mystical crucible.<BR>A cauldron is the right shape and size, but what is effectively a big metal bowl will never be able to hold the magical energies I wish to manipulate.<BR>Once again applying some Salis Mundus to a cauldron should resolve my problems.
research.UNLOCKALCHEMY.stage.3=I have my crucible! Now I need something to experiment with, and I happen to have the perfect thing. I have spent many a late-night studying thaumaturgy and flickering torchlight is not the best thing to read by. A steady magical light is exactly what I need now.<BR>Glowstone is a steady source of light, but I require large handfuls of it for a light source and it lacks... style. I am sure I can alter it into something better.<BR>The crucible needs to be placed over a source of heat and filled with water. Once the water boils I can start adding the things I need. I have jotted down a recipe that I think will create a substance I have named Nitor. A small core of energized glowstone empowered with energy, fire and light should burn forever. It should be naturally buoyant, allowing it to be placed anyway - even floating in mid-air.<BR>I simply need to find objects with the required essentia (shift-click while hovering over an item might help here) and throw them into the crucible.<BR>The crucible will render them down into their constituent essentia. I might not be able to gather the exact combination of essentia I require, but if there are enough of the types I need everything should be fine.<BR>Once I have enough all I need to do is throw in the catalyst. In this case a handful of glowstone dust.<BR>If all goes well the glowstone will absorb the essentia and transform into nitor.<BR>I am not sure what will happen to the excess essentia, but I can only assume it will eventually dissolve harmlessly.<BR>[Shift-right clicking with an empty hand will empty a crucible. Each crafting operation will consume some of the water so you will have to replenish it now and again.]
research.UNLOCKALCHEMY.title=Discovering Alchemy
research.UNLOCKARTIFICE.stage.1=I have learned much and one of those things is how much more I still have to learn. The worlds revealed to me are arcane and mysterious with many invisible wonders... and dangers.<BR>I need a tool that will allow me to see the unseen and ease my journey of discovery. The old texts I have read make mention of a set of goggles commonly used by thaumaturges for just this purpose.<BR>Alas the text does not mention exactly how they work, so I will need to design my own from first principles.
research.UNLOCKARTIFICE.stage.2=I have penned my own designs based on the little information I could find and my own experimental findings. Time to put theory into practice.<BR>I have also managed to expand on my research into enchanted fabric and apply it to the goggles. Not only will they reveal hidden things, but they will also reduce the vis cost of certain thaumaturgical tasks.<BR>Lastly these goggles will allow me to see the vis or essentia content of objects in the world which will prove a great boon I am sure.

research.WARP.stage.1=Many believe man was not meant to meddle with magic, and nothing gives more credence to this than the existence of Warp.<BR>Researching forbidden magics or crafting objects of a questionable nature tends to distort a thaumaturge's view of reality, twisting both their minds and their bodies. This effect is called Warp.<BR>While some warp gained is temporary and will fade over time, there is no known way to get rid of permanent Warp once it is gained and a thaumaturge who chooses to ignore the dangers in the pursuit of power often finds himself on a slippery slope.<BR>Warp usually manifests as minor lapses in concentration, physical pain or hallucinations.<BR>These are more than merely mental though, as the visions sometimes impart useful knowledge or seeming hallucinations prove to be frighteningly real.<BR>I should monitor my mental well being carefully and to that end I have designed a device that should show me exactly how even me keel is at the moment.
research.WARP.title=Warp
research.WARP.warn=My mind reels from the knowledge I have gained
research.WORKBENCHCHARGER.stage.1=I am beginning to run into an annoying limitation with the arcane workbench. It is only able to draw vis from its immediate surroundings. While this is fine for most of the things I have been crafting so far, I soon foresee a time where I will have to craft something that requires more vis than there is nearby.<BR>I need to find a way to extend the reach of the arcane workbench. The further it can reach to draw vis, the more vis will be available for crafting.
research.WORKBENCHCHARGER.stage.2=I have designed a special rig that can be placed on top of the arcane workbench. This framework allows the workbench to draw vis not only from the chunk it is located in, but the surrounding 8 chunks as well. In theory this increases the vis available for crafting ninefold.<BR>When vis is drawn from the aura it will be roughly split between all 9 those chunks which should prevent depletion of a single chunk.
research.WORKBENCHCHARGER.title=Arcane Workbench Charger
research.Wisp.stage.1=These strange creatures appear to be floating points of light and are often found near high concentrations of vis. Honestly I am not sure if they are creatures at all - they move randomly and do not appear to exhibit the normal characteristics of a living organism. They do however react to being attacked and occasionally become aggressive for no apparent reason.<BR>My initial thoughts are they might be a form of proto-life made up of vis instead of normal matter, but that cannot be the whole picture as I am detecting strange dimensional energies at their core.
