ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.wires.nam=Industrial Wires
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.wires.subtex=No complex impedance!
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.wires=Wires from the IndustrialWires company allow you to transfer energy like you can with cables from the IndustrialCraft2 company.<br>You use them exactly as you would use wires from Immersive Engineering. Each wire transfers as much EU as the corresponding cable would, so
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.wires=attaching a connector to a power source that would destroy the cable will destroy the connector.<br>The wire coils for the IC2 cable are different from the Immersive Engineering wire coils in that longer connections use up more wire: The coils are crafted by placing any combination of uninsulated IC2 cables and the corresponding wire coils in a crafting grid. The next page shows some examples of valid recipes and their outputs. The uninsulated
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.wires=tin cables can be replaced by uninsulated copper, gold or HV cables or by glass fiber cable to craft the other coils.


ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.mechConv.nam=Mechanical Converters
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.mechConv.subtex=I made rotational energy for this!
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.mechConv=Both the IC2 and IE company produce products that run on kinetic energy of some sort. The new converters from IndustrialWires allow you to convert between these two forms of energy!<br>To use the "Converter: Rotational To Kinetic" attach a source of IE rotational energy
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.mechConv=like a waterwheel or a motor (see page 3) to the side marked with a gear and a consumer of IC2 kinetic energy to the opposite side. The "Converter: Kinetic To Rotational" is used in a similar way (Rotational and kinetic energy have to be swapped).<br>Unfortunately some energy is
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.mechConv=lost with each conversion.<br>As a little extra the "Mechanical converter" product series also contains a Rotational Motor: It consumes IF to produce IE rotational energy. As with the converters this is not a lossless process.


ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.jacobs.nam=Jacob's Ladders
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.jacobs.subtex=Probably contain PCB's!
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.jacobs=By applying a high voltage between 2 electrodes forming a "V" one can create an arc travelling upwards. They don't serve a particular purpose apart from being a nice-looking waste of power. Power can be supplied using either Flux or EU. The energy usage varies with the size of the ladder.
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.jacobs=These are the required power values in EU: <config;dA;iwJacobsUsage>. Due to the voltages involved touching the ladder while active is not a good idea. Applying salt to the electrodes will cause the arc to be colored orange for a short time due to the sodium contained in the salt.






ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.intro.nam=Introduction
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.intro.subtex=
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.intro=Control Panels allow you to monitor and control a large amount of redstone signals using only a few blocks. Those signals can currently be connected using redstone wires and connectors.<br>Buttons, switches, indicator lights and other things that can be placed on a control panel are called §l(Panel) Components§r<br>To create a control panel you will need a Panel Creator, the individual components and an Unfinished Panel (which determines the shape of the
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.intro=panel). Each component is described in the entry "Panel Components". Right-clicking with a panel component opens up a GUI in which the properties of the component, like the redstone channel and ID or the color, can be configured.
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.intro=A §l(panel) network§r is formed by panel blocks connected to each other, directly or through other panel blocks. Panel blocks include the control panel itself, the panel connector and the Redstone Wire Controller. If multiple components in one network are configured to modify the same
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.intro=redstone signal, the resulting signal will be the highest of the individual signals. Having multiple components accepting the same signal on a network is valid as well.
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.intro=The §lUnfinished Control Panel§r is used as the casing of a control panel. It can be configured by putting it into an Engineer's Workbench. The slider labeled "Height" changes the height in the middle of the panel. The "Angle" slider changes the angle of the panel relative to the surface it is
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.intro=placed on, creating tilted panels. The sliders will automatically clamp to the highest/lowest angle/height the panel can have without being partially outside the block. The values might not visually clamp due to the way the Workbench works, closing and re-opening the GUI should fix this.


ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.panel_creator.nam=Panel Creator
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.panel_creator.subtex=
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.panel_creator=The GUI of the panel creator consists of two major sections: The controls on the left and the panel on the right. Components can be placed on the panel by "placing" the items in the corresponding point in the GUI. If the component is surrounded by a red area, it can not be placed in that
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.panel_creator=position on the panel. This usually means that it is either overlapping with an other component or isn't completely on the panel.<br>The top button on the left (D) disassembles an existing control panel when it is placed in the slot beneath the button: The components of that panel are placed in the GUI, allowing them to be repositioned. The casing is lost in this process.<br>The next button (C) places the components from the right of the GUI on an Unfinished Control Panel in the slot in the
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.panel_creator=left of the GUI, turning it into a regular Control Panel.<br>The button labeled R removes all components from the GUI panel area and places them in your inventory.<br>Finally the last button (S) changes between being able to place components anywhere on the panel to only being able to place them on a 16x16 grid.


ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.redstone.nam=Redstone Connections
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.redstone.subtex=Could also be blood vessels
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.redstone=A panel network can contain any amount of §lRedstone Wire Controllers§r. Each controller should be assigned a different ID in its GUI. Each component that interacts with redstone signals has two settings in its GUI: A redstone channel color and a controller ID. To get the redstone signals out of and into the controller it needs to be connected to redstone
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.redstone=connectors from Immersive Engineering.


ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.components.nam=Panel Components
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.components.subtex=More than just two
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.components.genera=The settings of any component can be copied to a component of the same type by placing the components directly above each other in a crafting bench. The settings of the upper component will be copied to the lower.
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.butto=A simple button that activates a redstone signal when pressed. Its color can be changed. The button either stays on until clicked again (latching) or tuns off after half a second (non-latching).
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.labe=A text that can be placed on the control panel, for example to indicate the purpose of some other component. The color and obviously the text can be edited.
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.indicator_ligh=A small indicator that brightens as the input redstone signal is increased. The color can be changed.
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.slide=A sliding switch that can set an output redstone signal to any desired signal strength. It can be either vertically or horizontally aligned and can have any length between one eighth of a block and one block. The color of the sliding knob can be changed.
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.toggle_switc=A switch to turn a signal on or off. The covered version includes a cover to prevent accidental activation: When clicked for the first time the cover will open, the signal will be turned on by clicking once again. Another click will close the cover and turn off the output signal. If the cover was opened by accident it can be closed by shift-right-clicking
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.toggle_switch=the switch. The color of the cover can be configured.
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.varia=A Variac® is a variable autotransformer. The output signal of the transformer increases as the knob is turned to the right. The signal strenght can only be increased by one unit per click.
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.loc=A lock switch activates a redstone signal when a key is inserted and turned. A newly crafted lock will have a unique key configuration. By placing a blank key and a lock in a crafting table a key for the lock can be created. Multiple locks fitting the same key can be created using component copying (see page 1). Keys can be named in a GUI opened by right-clicking with them.
ie.manual.entry.industrialwires.panel_mete=A panel meter can be used to show display analog redstone signals with some accuracy. Panel meters are available in two different formats, wide and narrow. The wide format gives a slightly bigger angle between redstone level 0 and 15, but is more typical for Multimeters that for panel meters.
