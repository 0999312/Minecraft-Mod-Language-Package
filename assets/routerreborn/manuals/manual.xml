	<title>Router</title>
	<text> 
The router has the following modes:
* Extract
* Output
 
It also has the ability to eject items when
 clogged if it is in Output mode and a eject
 upgrade is installed.
 
Side selection in the main tab is where you
 can choose what side on a target inventory
 and not the side of the router it should
 try to insert to or extract from.

An example would be an array of vanilla
 furnaces where you would like to insert ores
 at the top and coal at the sides, or extract
 from the bottom.
 
When in slot mode, all sides on the target
 are checked for access to the given slot.

<text>Thorough:

Will make the router try and fill all slots
 in 1 target before moving on to the next.

Keep in mind if you put random items in the
 router, a item not able to enter the
 target will force the router to move on to
 the next available target.

It will be useful in a array of furnaces where
 you want to fill 1 furnace with a type of ore 
 before moving on to the next.
 
Without thorough the items will be spread out
 over all available targets.

<text>Speed Upgrade:

This is handy in a barrel like sorting system
 where you need the router to skip barrels
 that can not take the current item quickly.

It will make the router jump to the next
 available target immediately instead of
 (default config with a tickrate of 2)
 10 each second.

With a setup of 200 barrels where only 1
 barrel can accept the item it will take 20
 seconds to find it without a speed upgrade.

<text>Bandwidth Upgrade:

Will make the router transfer a stack instead
 of a single item each time.
 
Combine this with a speed upgrade and Storage
 Units and it can handle sorting from 2-3 
 Buildcraft quarry's at full speed.

<text>Eject Upgrade:

Allows the router to eject items to a chest or
 pipe on the chosen side when in extract mode.
 
When in output mode this upgrade work as a
 protection against blocking the router with
 a item that has nowhere to go.
If the router can not find a inventory to put
 the current item in it will try and eject it
 to a chest or pipe on the chosen side.

They can be blacklisted or whitelisted.
Items will not be used up when put in the
 filter.

 copper ore will allow all copper ores to pass.

<text>Machine Filter:

Allows you to specify what machine to interact
 with, blacklist or whitelist can be selected.

 Visit near.
   Visit near work in the following way:
   
   You got a chest, then a furnace, and
    then a chest again.
   
   Selecting the chest in the filter only the
    first chest will be transfered to, when
    the router hit a inventory that is not
    selected it will not go beyond it.

<text>Example for autosorting storage:

Best solution for a complete storage
system would be Speed Upgrade, Bandwith,
 Eject and Thorough.
 
Thorough will make sure a item do not 
 end up in 2 different units even if 
 the units are not locked.

Eject when in output mode with a chest
 next to the router selected for eject
 will ensure the system do not clog up
 on items that has nowhere to go.

Speed upgrade will ensure that finding
 the next storage unit or any other 
 storage you may use is fast and do not
 take so long the system backs up.
 
Bandwith make sure a full stack is 
 transfered each time if a full stack
 can fit the target inventory.
 
A setup like this can easily handle
several quarrys at full speed.
